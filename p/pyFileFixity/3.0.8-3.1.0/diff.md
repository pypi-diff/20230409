 pyFileFixity provides a suite of open source, cross-platform, easy
 to use and easy to maintain (readable code) to protect and manage data
-for long term storage/archival, and also test the performance of any data protection algorithms.
+for long term storage/archival, and also test the performance of any data protection algorithm.
 
 The project is done in pure-Python to meet those criteria,
 although cythonized extensions are available for core routines to speed up encoding/decoding,
 but always with a pure python specification available so as to allow long term replication.
 
 Here is an example of what pyFileFixity can do:

 Quickstart
 ----------
 
 Runs on Python 3 up to Python 3.11. Both PyPy 3 and PyPy 2 are supported. Older versions such as Python 2.7.10 are still being automatically unit tested with continuous integration but support can be dropped at any moment.
 
-- To install or update:
+- To install or update on Python 3:
 
 ``pip install --upgrade pyfilefixity``
 
-- To generate a monitoring database (to later check if files were changed, but no possibility of repairing):
+- For Python 2.7, the latest working version was v3.0.2:
 
-``python rfigc.py -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -g -f -l "log.txt"``
+``pip install --upgrade pyfilefixity==3.0.2 reedsolo==1.7.0 unireedsolomon==1.0.5``
+
+- Once installed, the suite of tools can be accessed from a centralized interface script called ``pff`` which provides several subcommands, to list them:
+
+``pff --help``
+
+You should see:
+
+::
+
+    usage: pff [-h]
+               {hash,rfigc,header,header_ecc,hecc,whole,structural_adaptive_ecc,saecc,protect,repair,recover,repair_ecc,recc,dup,replication_repair,restest,resilience_tester,filetamper,speedtest,ecc_speedtest}
+               ...
+
+    positional arguments:
+      {hash,rfigc,header,header_ecc,hecc,whole,structural_adaptive_ecc,saecc,protect,repair,recover,repair_ecc,recc,dup,replication_repair,restest,resilience_tester,filetamper,speedtest,ecc_speedtest}
+        hash (rfigc)        Check files integrity fast by hash, size, modification date or by data structure integrity.
+        header (header_ecc, hecc)
+                            Protect/repair files headers with error correction codes
+        whole (structural_adaptive_ecc, saecc, protect, repair)
+                            Protect/repair whole files with error correction codes
+        recover (repair_ecc, recc)
+                            Utility to try to recover damaged ecc files using a failsafe mechanism, a sort of recovery
+                            mode (note: this does NOT recover your files, only the ecc files, which may then be used to
+                            recover your files!)
+        dup (replication_repair)
+                            Repair files from multiple copies of various storage mediums using a majority vote
+        restest (resilience_tester)
+                            Run tests to quantify robustness of a file protection scheme (can be used on any, not just
+                            pyFileFixity)
+        filetamper          Tamper files using various schemes
+        speedtest (ecc_speedtest)
+                            Run error correction encoding and decoding speedtests
+
+    options:
+      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
+
+- Every subcommands provide their own more detailed help instructions, eg for the ``hash`` submodule:
+
+``pff hash --help``
+
+- To generate a monitoring database (to later check very fast which files are corrupted, but cannot repair anything but filesystem metadata):
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -g -f -l "log.txt"``
 
 Note: this also works for a single file, just replace "your_folder" by "your_file.ext".
 
-- To check if files were corrupted:

-pyFileFixity provides a suite of open source, cross-platform, easy
-to use and easy to maintain (readable code) to protect and manage data
-for long term storage/archival, and also test the performance of any data protection algorithms.
-
-The project is done in pure-Python to meet those criteria,
-although cythonized extensions are available for core routines to speed up encoding/decoding,
-but always with a pure python specification available so as to allow long term replication.
-
-Here is an example of what pyFileFixity can do:
-
-|Example|
-
-On the left, this is the original image.
-
-At the center, the same image but
-with a few symbols corrupted (only 3 in header and 2 in the rest of the file,
-which equals to 5 bytes corrupted in total, over 19KB which is the total file size).
-Only a few corrupted bytes are enough to make the image looks like totally
-unrecoverable, and yet we are lucky, because the image could be unreadable at all
-if any of the "magic bytes" were to be corrupted!
-
-At the right, the corrupted image was repaired using `header_ecc.py` of pyFileFixity.
-This repaired only the image header (ie, the first part of the file), so only the first
-3 corrupted bytes were repaired, not the 2 bytes in the rest of the file, but we can see
-the image looks like it's totally repaired! And the best thing is that it only costed the generation
-of a "ecc repair file", which size is only 3.3KB (17% of the original file)!
-
-This works because most files will store the most important information to read them at
-their beginning, also called "file's header", so repairing this part will almost always ensure
-the possibility to read the file (even if the rest of the file is still corrupted, if the header is safe,
-you can read it).
-
-Of course, you can also protect the whole file, not only the header, using pyFileFixity's
-`structural_adaptive_ecc.py`. You can also detect any corruption using `rfigc.py`.

-death (in this case, the death of data). Indeed, because of entropy,
-data will eventually fade away because of various silent errors such as
-bit rot or cosmic rays. pyFileFixity aims to provide tools to detect any data
-corruption, but also fight data corruption by providing repairing tools.
-
-The only solution is to use a principle of engineering that is long
-known and which makes bridges safe: add some **redundancy**.
-
-There are only 2 ways to add redundancy:
-
--  the simple way to add redundancy is to **duplicate** the object (also
-   called replication), but for data storage, this eats up a lot of storage
-   and is not optimal.
--  the second way, and the best, optimal tools ever invented to recover
-   from data corruption, are the **error correction codes** (forward
-   error correction), which are a way to smartly produce redundant codes
-   from your data so that you can later repair your data using these
-   additional pieces of information (ie, an ECC generates n blocks for a
-   file cut in k blocks (with k < n), and then the ecc code can rebuild
-   the whole file with (at least) any k blocks among the total n blocks
-   available). In other words, you can correct up to (n-k) erasures. But
-   error correcting codes can also detect and repair automatically where
-   the errors are (fully automatic data repair for you !), but at the
-   cost that you can then only correct (n-k)/2 errors.
-
-Error correction can seem a bit magical, but for a reasonable intuition,
-it can be seen as a way to average the corruption error rate: on
-average, a bit will still have the same chance to be corrupted, but
-since you have more bits to represent the same data, you lower the
-overall chance to lose this bit.
-
-The problem is that most theoretical and pratical works on error
-correcting codes has been done almost exclusively on channel
-transmission (such as 4G, internet, etc.), but not on data storage,
-which is very different for one reason: whereas in a channel we are in a
-spatial scheme (both the sender and the receiver are different entities
-in space but working at the same timescale), in data storage this is a
-temporal scheme: the sender was you storing the data on your medium at
-time t, and the receiver is again you but now retrieving the data at
-time t+x. Thus, the sender does not exist anymore, thus you cannot ask
-the sender to send again some data if it's too much corrupted: in data
-storage, if a data is corrupted, it's lost for good, whereas in channel theory,
-parts of the data can be submitted again if necessary.
-
-Some attempts were made to translate channel theory and error correcting
-codes theory to data storage, the first being Reed-Solomon which spawned
-the RAID schema. Then CIRC (Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding) was
-devised for use on optical discs to recover from scratches, which was
-necessary for the technology to be usable for consumers. Since then, new
-less-optimal but a lot faster algorithms such as LDPC, turbo-codes and
-fountain codes such as RaptorQ were invented (or rediscovered), but they
-are still marginally researched for data storage.
-
-This project aims to, first, implement easy tools to evaluate strategies
-(filetamper.py) and file fixity (ie, detect if there are corruptions),
-and then the goal is to provide an open and easy framework to use
-different kinds of error correction codes to protect and repair files.
-
-Also, the ecc file specification is made to be simple and resilient to
-corruption, so that you can process it by your own means if you want to,
-without having to study for hours how the code works (contrary to PAR2
-format).
-
-In practice, both approaches are not exclusive, and the best is to
-combine them: protect the most precious data with error correction codes,
-then duplicate them across multiple storage mediums. Hence, this suite of
-data protection tools, just like any other such suite, is not sufficient to
-guarantee your data is protected, you must have an active data curation strategy
-which includes regularly checking your data and replacing copies that are damaged.
-
-For a primer on storage mediums and data protection strategies, see `this post I wrote <https://web.archive.org/web/20220529125543/https://superuser.com/questions/374609/what-medium-should-be-used-for-long-term-high-volume-data-storage-archival/873260>`_.
-
-Why not just use RAID ?
------------------------
-
-RAID is clearly insufficient for long-term data storage, and in fact it
-was primarily meant as a cheap way to get more storage (RAID0) or more
-availability (RAID1) of data, not for archiving data, even on a medium
-timescale:
-
--  RAID 0 is just using multiple disks just like a single one, to extend
-   the available storage. Let's skip this one.
--  RAID 1 is mirroring one disk with a bit-by-bit copy of another disk.
-   That's completely useless for long term storage: if either disk
-   fails, or if both disks are partially corrupted, you can't know what
-   are the correct data and which aren't. As an old saying goes: "Never
-   take 2 compasses: either take 3 or 1, because if both compasses show
-   different directions, you will never know which one is correct, nor
-   if both are wrong." That's the principle of Triplication.
--  RAID 5 is based on the triplication idea: you have n disks (but least
-   3), and if one fails you can recover n-1 disks (resilient to only 1
-   disk failure, not more).
--  RAID 6 is an extension of RAID 5 which is closer to error-correction
-   since you can correct n-k disks. However, most (all?) currently
-   commercially available RAID6 devices only implements recovery for at
-   most n-2 (2 disks failures).
--  In any case, RAID cannot detect silent errors automatically, thus you
-   either have to regularly scan, or you risk to lose some of your data
-   permanently, and it's far more common than you can expect (eg, with
-   RAID5, it is enough to have 2 silent errors on two disks on the same
-   bit for the bit to be unrecoverable). That's why a limit of only 1 or
-   2 disks failures is just not enough.
-
-On the opposite, ECC can correct n-k disks (or files). You can configure
-n and k however you want, so that for example you can set k = n/2, which
-means that you can recover all your files from only half of them! (once
-they are encoded with an ecc file of course).
-
-There also are new generation RAID solutions, mainly software based,
-such as SnapRAID or ZFS, which allow you to configure a virtual RAID
-with the value n-k that you want. This is just like an ecc file (but a
-bit less flexible, since it's not a file but a disk mapping, so that you
-can't just copy it around or upload it to a cloud backup hosting). In
-addition to recover (n-k) disks, they can also be configured to recover
-from partial, sectors failures inside the disk and not just the whole
-disk (for a more detailed explanation, see Plank, James S., Mario Blaum,
-and James L. Hafner. "SD codes: erasure codes designed for how storage
-systems really fail." FAST. 2013.).
-
-The other reason RAID is not adapted to long-term storage, is that it
-supposes you store your data on hard-drives exclusively. Hard drives
-aren't a good storage medium for the long term, for two reasons:
-
-| 1- they need a regular plug to keep the internal magnetic disks
-  electrified (else the data will just fade away when there's no
-  residual electricity).
-| 2- the reading instrument is directly included and merged with the
-  data (this is the green electronic board you see from the outside, and
-  the internal head). This is good for quick consumer use (don't need to
-  buy another instrument: the HDD can just be plugged and it works), but
-  it's very bad for long term storage, because the reading instrument is
-  bound to fail, and a lot faster than the data can fade away: this
-  means that even if your magnetic disks inside your HDD still holds
-  your data, if the controller board or the head doesn't work anymore,
-  your data is just lost. And a head (and a controller board) are almost
-  impossible to replace, even by professionals, because the pieces are
-  VERY hard to find (different for each HDD production line) and each
-  HDD has some small physical defects, thus it's impossible to reproduce
-  that too (because the head is so close to the magnetic disk that if
-  you try to do that manually you'll probably fail).
-
-In the end, it's a lot better to just separate the storage medium of
-data, with the reading instrument. The medium I advise is optical disks
-(whether it's BluRay, DVD, CD or whatever), because the reading
-instrument is separate, and the technology (laser reflecting on bumps
-and/or pits) is kind of universal, so that even if the technology is
-lost one day (deprecated by newer technologies, so that you can't find
-the reading instrument anymore because it's not sold anymore), you can
-probably emulate a laser using some software to read your optical disk,
-just like what the CAMiLEON project did to recover data from the
-LaserDiscs of the BBC Domesday Project (see Wikipedia).
-
-Applications included
----------------------
-
-The project currently include the following pure-python applications:
-
--  rfigc.py, a hash auditing tool, similar to md5deep/hashdeep, to
-   compute a database of your files along with their metadata, so that
-   later you can check if they were changed/corrupted.
-
--  header\_ecc.py, an error correction code using Reed-Solomon
-   generator/corrector for files headers. The idea is to supplement
-   other more common redundancy tools such as PAR2 (which is quite
-   reliable), by adding more resiliency only on the critical parts of
-   the files: their headers. Using this script, you can significantly
-   higher the chance of recovering headers, which will allow you to at
-   least open the files.
-
--  structural\_adaptive\_ecc.py, a variable error correction rate
-   encoder (kind of a generalization of header\_ecc.py). This script
-   allows to generate an ecc file for the whole content of your files,
-   not just the header part, using a variable resilience rate: the
-   header part will be the most protected, then the rest of each file
-   will be progressively encoded with a smaller and smaller resilience
-   rate. The assumption is that important information is stored first,
-   and then data becomes less and less informative (and thus important,
-   because the end of the file describes less important details). This
-   assumption is very true for all compressed kinds of formats, such as
-   JPG, ZIP, Word, ODT, etc...
-
--  repair\_ecc.py, a script to repair the structure (ie, the entry and
-   fields markers/separators) of an ecc file generated by header\_ecc.py
-   or structural\_adaptive\_ecc.py. The goal is to enhance the
-   resilience of ecc files against corruption by ensuring that their
-   structures can be repaired (up to a certain point which is very high
-   if you use an index backup file, which is a companion file that is
-   generated along an ecc file).
-
--  filetamper.py is a quickly made file corrupter, it will erase or
-   change characters in the specified file. This is useful for testing
-   your various protecting strategies and file formats (eg: is PAR2
-   really resilient against corruption? Are zip archives still partially
-   extractable after corruption or are rar archives better? etc.). Do
-   not underestimate the usefulness of this tool, as you should always
-   check the resiliency of your file formats and of your file protection
-   strategies before relying on them.
-
--  easy\_profiler.py is just a quick and simple profiling tool to get
-   you started quickly on what should be optimized to get more speed, if
-   you want to contribute to the project feel free to propose a pull
-   request! (Cython and other optimizations are welcome as long as they
-   are cross-platform and that an alternative pure-python implementation
-   is also available).
-
--  replication\_repair.py takes advantage of your multiple copies
-   (replications) of your data over several storage mediums to recover
-   your data in case it gets corrupted. The goal is to take advantage of
-   the storage of your archived files into multiple locations: you will
-   necessarily make replications, so why not use them for repair?
-   Indeed, it's good practice to keep several identical copies of your data
-   on several storage mediums, but in case a corruption happens,
-   usually you will just drop the corrupted copies and keep the intacts ones.
-   However, if all copies are partially corrupted, you're stuck. This script
-   aims to take advantage of these multiple copies to recover your data,
-   without generating a prior ecc file. It works simply by reading through all
-   your different copies of your data, and it casts a majority vote over each
-   byte: the one that is the most often occuring will be kept. In engineering,
-   this is a very common strategy used for very reliable systems such as
-   space rockets, and is called "triple-modular redundancy", because you need
-   at least 3 copies of your data for the majority vote to work (but the more the
-   better).
-
--  resiliency\_tester.py allows you to test the robustness of the
-   corruption correction of the scripts provided here (or any other
-   command-line app). You just have to copy the files you want to test inside a
-   folder, and then the script will copy the files into a test tree, then it
-   will automatically corrupt the files randomly (you can change the parameters
-   like block burst and others), then it will run the file repair command-lines
-   you supply and finally some stats about the repairing power will be
-   generated. This allows you to easily and objectively compare different set
-   of parameters, or even different file repair solutions, on the very data
-   that matters to you, so that you can pick the best option for you.
-
-Note that all tools are primarily made for command-line usage (type
-script.py --help to get extended info about the accepted arguments), but
-you can also use rfigc.py and header\_ecc.py with a GUI by using the
---gui argument (must be the first and only one argument supplied). The
-GUI is provided as-is and minimal work will be done to maintain it (the
-focus will stay on functionality rather than ergonomy).
-
-IMPORTANT: it is CRITICAL that you use the same parameters for
-correcting mode as when you generated the database/ecc files (this is
-true for all scripts in this bundle). Of course, some options must be
-changed: -g must become -c to correct, and --update is a particular
-case. This works this way on purpose for mainly two reasons: first
-because it is very hard to autodetect the parameters from a database
-file alone and it would produce lots of false positives, and secondly
-(the primary reason) is that storing parameters inside the database file
-is highly unresilient against corruption (if this part of the database
-is tampered, the whole becomes unreadable, while if they are stored
-outside or in your own memory, the database file is always accessible).
-Thus, it is advised to write down the parameters you used to generate
-your database directly on the storage media you will store your database
-file on (eg: if it's an optical disk, write the parameters on the cover
-or directly on the disk using a marker), or better memorize them by
-heart. If you forget them, don't panic, the parameters are always stored
-as comments in the header of the generated ecc files, but you should try
-to store them outside of the ecc files anyway.
-
-For users: what's the advantage of pyFileFixity?
-------------------------------------------------
-
-Pros:
-
--  Open application and open specifications under the MIT license (you
-   can do whatever you want with it and tailor it to your needs if you
-   want to, or add better decoding procedures in the future as science
-   progress so that you can better recover your data from your already
-   generated ecc file).
--  Highly reliable file fixity watcher: rfigc.py will tell you without
-   any ambiguity using several attributes if your files have been
-   corrupted or not, and can even check for images if the header is
-   valid (ie: if the file can still be opened).
--  Readable ecc file format (compared to PAR2 and most other similar
-   specifications).
--  Highly resilient ecc file format against corruption (not only are
-   your data protected by ecc, the ecc file is protected too against
-   critical spots, both because there is no header so that each track is
-   independent and if one track is corrupted beyond repair then other
-   ecc tracks can still be read, and a .idx file will be generated to
-   repair the structure of the ecc file to recover all tracks).
--  Very safe and conservative approach: the recovery process checks that
-   the recovery was successful before committing a repaired block.
--  Partial recovery allowed (even if a file cannot be completely
-   recovered, the parts that can will be repaired and then the rest that
-   can't be repaired will be recopied from the corrupted version).
--  Support directory processing: you can encode an ecc file for a whole
-   directory of files (with any number of sub-directories and depth).
--  No limit on the number of files, and it can recursively protect files
-   in a directory tree.
--  Variable resiliency rate and header-only resilience, ensuring that
-   you can always open your files even if partially corrupted (the
-   structure of your files will be saved, so that you can use other
-   softwares to repair beyond if this set of script is not sufficient to
-   totally repair).
--  Support for erasures (null bytes) and even errors-and-erasures, which
-   literally doubles the repair capabilities. To my knowledge, this is
-   the only freely available parity software that supports erasures.
--  Display the predicted total ecc file size given your parameters,
-   and the total time it will take to encode/decode.
--  Opensourced under the very permissive MIT licence, do whatever you
-   want!
-
-Cons:
-
--  Cannot protect meta-data, such as folders paths. The paths are
-   stored, but cannot be recovered (yet? feel free to contribute if you
-   know how). Only files are protected. Thus if your OS or your storage
-   medium crashes and truncate a whole directory tree, the directory
-   tree can't be repaired using the ecc file, and thus you can't access
-   the files neither. However, you can use file scraping to extract the
-   files even if the directory tree is lost, and then use RFIGC.py to
-   reorganize your files correctly. There are alternatives, see the
-   chapters below: you can either package all your files in a single
-   archive using DAR or ZIP (thus the ecc will also protect meta-data), or see
-   DVDisaster as an alternative solution, which is an ecc generator with
-   support for directory trees meta-data (but only on optical disks).
--  Can only repair errors and erasures (characters that are replaced by
-   another character), not deletion nor insertion of characters. However
-   this should not happen with any storage medium (truncation can occur
-   if the file bounds is misdetected, in this case pyFileFixity can
-   partially repair the known parts of the file, but cannot recover the
-   rest past the truncation, except if you used a resiliency rate of at
-   least 0.5, in which case any message block can be recreated with only
-   using the ecc file).
--  Cannot recreate a missing file from other available files (except you
-   have set a resilience\_rate at least 0.5), contrary to Parchives
-   (PAR1/PAR2). Thus, you can only repair a file if you still have it on
-   your filesystem. If it's missing, pyFileFixity cannot do anything
-   (yet, this will be implemented in the future).
-
-Note that the tools were meant for data archival (protect files that you
-won't modify anymore), not for system's files watching nor to protect
-all the files on your computer. To do this, you can use a filesystem
-that directly integrate error correction code capacity, such as ZFS.
-
-Recursive/Relative Files Integrity Generator and Checker in Python (aka RFIGC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Recursively generate or check the integrity of files by MD5 and SHA1
-hashes, size, modification date or by data structure integrity (only for
-images).
-
-This script is originally meant to be used for data archival, by
-allowing an easy way to check for silent file corruption. Thus, this
-script uses relative paths so that you can easily compute and check the
-same redundant data copied on different mediums (hard drives, optical
-discs, etc.). This script is not meant for system files corruption
-notification, but is more meant to be used from times-to-times to check
-up on your data archives integrity (if you need this kind of application,
-see `avpreserve's fixity <https://github.com/avpreserve/fixity>`_).
-
-Example usage
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
--  To generate the database (only needed once):
-
-``python rfigc.py -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -g``
-
--  To check:
-
-``python rfigc.py -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -l log.txt -s``
-
--  To update your database by appending new files:
-
-``python rfigc.py -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a``
-
--  To update your database by appending new files AND removing
-   inexistent files:
-
-``python rfigc.py -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a -r``
-
-Note that by default, the script is by default in check mode, to avoid
-wrong manipulations. It will also alert you if you generate over an
-already existing database file.

-
-Header Error Correction Code script
------------------------------------
-
-This script was made to be used in combination with other more common
-file redundancy generators (such as PAR2, I advise MultiPar). This is an
-additional layer of protection for your files: by using a higher
-resiliency rate on the headers of your files, you ensure that you will
-be probably able to open them in the future, avoiding the "critical
-spots", also called "fracture-critical" in redundancy engineering (where
-if you modify just one bit, your whole file may become unreadable,
-usually bits residing in the headers - in other words, a single blow
-makes the whole thing collapse, just like non-redundant bridges).
-
-An interesting benefit of this approach is that it has a low storage
-(and computational) overhead that scales linearly to the number of
-files, whatever their size is: for example, if we have a set of 40k
-files for a total size of 60 GB, with a resiliency\_rate of 30% and
-header\_size of 1KB (we limit to the first 1K bytes/characters = our
-file header), then, without counting the hash per block and other
-meta-data, the final ECC file will be about 2 \* resiliency\_rate \*
-number\_of\_files \* header\_size = 24.5 MB. This size can be lower if
-there are many files smaller than 1KB. This is a pretty low storage
-overhead to backup the headers of such a big number of files.
-
-The script is pure-python as are its dependencies: it is thus completely
-cross-platform and open source. However, this imply that it is quite
-slow, but PyPy v2.5.0 was successfully tested against the script without
-any modification, and a speed increase of more 100x could be observed,
-so that you can expect a rate of more than 1MB/s, which is quite fast.
-
-Structural Adaptive Error Correction Encoder
---------------------------------------------
-
-This script implements a variable error correction rate encoder: each
-file is ecc encoded using a variable resiliency rate -- using a high
-constant resiliency rate for the header part (resiliency rate stage 1,
-high), then a variable resiliency rate is applied to the rest of the
-file's content, with a higher rate near the beginning of the file
-(resiliency rate stage 2, medium) which progressively decreases until
-the end of file (resiliency rate stage 3, the lowest).
-
-The idea is that the critical parts of files usually are placed at the
-top, and data becomes less and less critical along the file. What is
-meant by critical is both the critical spots (eg: if you tamper only one
-character of a file's header you have good chances of losing your entire
-file, ie, you cannot even open it) and critically encoded information
-(eg: archive formats usually encode compressed symbols as they go along
-the file, which means that the first occurrence is encoded, and then the
-archive simply writes a reference to the symbol. Thus, the first
-occurrence is encoded at the top, and subsequent encoding of this same
-data pattern will just be one symbol, and thus it matters less as long
-as the original symbol is correctly encoded and its information
-preserved, we can always try to restore the reference symbols later).
-Moreover, really redundant data will be placed at the top because they
-can be reused a lot, while data that cannot be too much compressed will
-be placed later, and thus, corruption of this less compressed data is a
-lot less critical because only a few characters will be changed in the
-uncompressed file (since the data is less compressed, a character change
-on the not-so-much compressed data won't have very significant impact on
-the uncompressed data).
-
-This variable error correction rate should allow to protect more the
-critical parts of a file (the header and the beginning of a file, for
-example in compressed file formats such as zip or jpg this is where the
-most importantly strings are encoded) for the same amount of storage as
-a standard constant error correction rate.
-
-Of course, you can set the resiliency rate for each stage to the values
-you want, so that you can even do the opposite: setting a higher
-resiliency rate for stage 3 than stage 2 will produce an ecc that is
-greater towards the end of the contents of your files.
-
-Furthermore, the currently designed format of the ecc file would allow
-two things that are not available in all current file ecc generators
-such as PAR2:
-
-1. it allows to partially repair a file, even if not all
-the blocks can be corrected (in PAR2, a file is repaired only if all
-blocks can be repaired, which is a shame because there are still other
-blocks that could be repaired and thus produce a less corrupted file) ;
-
-2. the ecc file format is quite simple and readable, easy to process by
-any script, which would allow other softwares to also work on it (and it
-was also done in this way to be more resilient against error
-corruptions, so that even if an entry is corrupted, other entries are
-independent and can maybe be used, thus the ecc is very error tolerant.
-This idea was implemented in repair\_ecc.py but it could be extended,
-especially if you know the pattern of the corruption).
-
-The script structural-adaptive-ecc.py implements this idea, which can be
-seen as an extension of header-ecc.py (and in fact the idea was the
-other way around: structural-adaptive-ecc.py was conceived first but was
-too complicated, then header-ecc.py was implemented as a working
-lessened implementation only for headers, and then
-structural-adaptive-ecc.py was finished using header-ecc.py code
-progress). It works, it was a quite well tested for my own needs on
-datasets of hundred of GB, but it's not foolproof so make sure you test
-the script by yourself to see if it's robust enough for your needs (any
-feedback about this would be greatly appreciated!).
-
-ECC Algorithms
---------------
-
-You can specify different ecc algorithms using the ``--ecc_algo`` switch.
-
-For the moment, only Reed-Solomon is implemented, but it's universal
-so you can modify its parameters in lib/eccman.py.
-
-Two Reed-Solomon codecs are available, they are functionally equivalent
-and thoroughly unit tested.
-
--  ``--ecc_algo 1``: use the first Reed-Solomon codec in galois field 2^8 of root 3 with fcr=1.
-   This is the slowest implementation (but also the most easy code to understand).
--  ``--ecc_algo 2``: same as algo 1 but with a faster functions.
--  ``--ecc_algo 3``: use the second codec, which is the fastest.
-   The generated ECC will be compatible with algo 1 and 2.
--  ``--ecc_algo 4``: also use the second, fastest RS codec, but
-   with different parameters (US FAA ADSB UAT RS FEC norm),
-   thus the generated ECC won't be compatible with algo 1 to 3.
-   But do not be scared, the ECC will work just the same.
-
-Cython implementation
----------------------
-
-This section describes how to use the Cython implementation. However,
-you should first try PyPy, as it may give great performances too.
-
-Simply follow the instruction to install the `reedsolo <https://github.com/tomerfiliba/reedsolomon/releases/tag/v2.0.5>`_ module with
-the cythonized module:
-
-.. code:: sh
-    
-    pip install --upgrade reedsolo --install-option="--cythonize" --verbose
-
-Then make sure to use ``ecc_algo=3`` in all your ``eccman`` calls, and you
-are then good to go, the cythonized module ``creedsolo`` will always be used
-for both encoding and decoding transparently.
-
-THE REST OF THIS SECTION IS OLD AND DEPRECATED, because the Cython compilation is now
-done directly in the Reed-Solomon submodules, instead of here, so you
-should not need to worry about it, just pip install with the requirements.txt
-and you should be set. The information below is left for historical purposes:
-
-A speedy Cython implementation of the Reed-Solomon library is included.
-It should provide C-speed for all scripts (as long as you use
---ecc\_algo 1 or 2, not 3 nor 4). It is not needed, since a pure-python
-implementation is used by default, but it can be useful if you want to
-encode big datasets of several hundred of GB.
-
-If you want to build the C/Cython implementation, do the following:
-
-1- Install a C compiler for your platform. On Linux, gcc should already
-be installed. On Windows, you need to use the Visual Studio C compiler
-(not MinGW nor Cygwin gcc, they won't work). You can use the "Microsoft
-Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7", and follow these instructions to
-make it work if you have Python < 2.7.10:
-
-https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/CythonExtensionsOnWindows
-
-2- cd to this folder (where pyFileFixity resides), and execute the
-following command:
-
-``python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=msvc``
-
-If everything goes alright, the C compiler will compile the .c files
-(that were pre-generated by Cython) and you can then use PyFileFixity
-scripts just as usual and you should see a huge speedup. Else, if it
-doesn't work, you might need to generate .c files using Cython for your
-platform (because the pre-generated .c files may be incompatible with
-your platform). To do that, you just need to install Cython, which is an
-easy task with nowadays Python distributions such as Anaconda: download
-32-bit Anaconda installer (on Windows you should avoid the 64-bit, it
-may produce weird issues with Cython), then after install, open the
-Anaconda Command Prompt and execute: ``conda install cython``. This will
-install all the necessary stuff along the cython library. Then you can
-simply execute again the command
-``python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=msvc`` and it will this
-time rebuild from scratch, by autodetecting that you have Cython
-installed, the setup.py script will automatically generate .c files from
-.pyx files and then .pyd files (binaries) from .c files.
-
-If you get issues, you can see the following post on how to install
-Cython:
-
-https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/InstallingOnWindows
-
-3- You can now launch pyFileFixity like usual, it should automatically
-detect the C/Cython compiled files and use that to speedup processing.
-
-Note about speed: Also, use a smaller --max\_block\_size to greatly
-speedup the operations! That's the trick used to compute very quickly RS
-ECC on optical discs. You give up a bit of resiliency of course (because
-blocks are smaller, thus you protect a smaller number of characters per
-ECC. In the end, this should not change much about real resiliency, but
-in case you get a big bit error burst on a contiguous block, you may
-lose a whole block at once. That's why using RS255 is better, but it's
-very time consuming. However, the resiliency ratios still hold, so for
-any other case of bit-flipping with average-sized bursts, this should
-not be a problem as long as the size of the bursts is smaller than an
-ecc block.)
-
-In case of a catastrophic event
--------------------------------
-
-TODO: write more here
-
-In case of a catastrophic event of your data due to the failure of your
-storage media (eg: your hard drive crashed), then follow the following
-steps:
-
-1- use dd\_rescue to make a full bit-per-bit verbatim copy of your drive
-before it dies. The nice thing with dd\_rescue is that the copy is
-exact, and also that it can retries or skip in case of bad sectors (it
-won't crash on your suddenly at half the process).
-
-2- Use testdisk to restore partition or to copy files based on partition
-filesystem informations.
-
-3- If you could not recover your files, you can try file scraping using
-`photorec <http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec>`_ or
-`plaso  <http://plaso.kiddaland.net/>`_ other similar tools as
-a last resort to extract data based only from files content (no filename,
-often uncorrect filetype, file boundaries may be wrong so some data
-may be cut off, etc.).
-
-4- If you used pyFileFixity before the failure of your storage media,
-you can then use your pre-computed databases to check that files are
-intact (rfigc.py) and if they aren't, you can recover them (using
-header\_ecc.py and structural\_adaptive\_ecc.py). It can also help if
-you recovered your files via data scraping, because your files will be
-totally unorganized, but you can use a previously generated database
-file to recover the full names and directory tree structure using
-rfigc.py --filescraping\_recover.
-
-Also, you can try to fix some of your files using specialized repairing
-tools (but remember that such tool cannot guarantee you the same
-recovering capacity as an error correction code - and in addition, error
-correction code can tell you when it has recovered successfully). For
-example:
-
--  for tar files, you can use `fixtar <https://github.com/BestSolution-at/fixtar>`_.
-   Similar tools (but older): `tarfix <http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/sw/unix/tarfix/>`_
-   and `tar-repair <https://www.datanumen.com/tar-repair/>`_.
--  for RAID mounting and recovery, you can use "Raid faster - recover
-   better" (rfrb) tool by Sabine Seufert and Christian Zoubek:
-   https://github.com/lrq3000/rfrb
--  if your unicode strings were mangled (ie, you see weird symbols),
-   try this script that will automatically demangle them:
-   https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy
--  to repair tabular (2D) data such as .csv, try
-   `Carpenter <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Carpenter/>`_.
--  tool to identify corrupted files in ddrescue images: 
-   `ddrescue-ffile <https://github.com/Salamek/ddrescue-ffile>`_
-
-Protecting directory tree meta-data
------------------------------------
-
-One main current limitation of pyFileFixity is that it cannot protect
-the directory tree meta-data. This means that in the worst case, if a
-silent error happens on the inode pointing to the root directory that
-you protected with an ecc, the whole directory will vanish, and all the
-files inside too. In less worst cases, sub-directories can vanish, but
-it's still pretty bad, and since the ecc file doesn't store any
-information about inodes, you can't recover the full path.
-
-The inability to store these meta-data is because of two choices in the
-design: 1- portability: we want the ecc file to work even if we move the
-root directory to another place or another storage medium (and of
-course, the inode would change), 2- cross-platform compatibility:
-there's no way to get and store directory meta-data for all platforms,
-but of course we could implement specific instructions for each main
-platform, so this point is not really a problem.
-
-To workaround this issue (directory meta-data are critical spots), other
-softwares use a one-time storage medium (ie, writing your data along
-with generating and writing the ecc). This way, they can access at
-the bit level the inode info, and they are guaranted that the inodes
-won't ever change. This is the approach taken by DVDisaster: by using
-optical mediums, it can compute inodes that will be permanent, and thus
-also encode that info in the ecc file. Another approach is to create a
-virtual filesystem specifically to store just your files, so that you
-manage the inode yourself, and you can then copy the whole filesystem
-around (which is really just a file, just like a zip file - which can
-also be considered as a mini virtual file system in fact) like
-`rsbep <http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/rsbep.html>`_.
-
-Here the portability principle of pyFileFixity prevents this approach.
-But you can mimic this workaround on your hard drive for pyFileFixity to
-work: you just need to package all your files into one file. This way,
-you sort of create a virtual file system: inside the archive, files and
-directories have meta-data just like in a filesystem, but from the
-outside it's just one file, composed of bytes that we can just encode to
-generate an ecc file - in other words, we removed the inodes portability
-problem, since this meta-data is stored relatively inside the archive,
-the archive manage it, and we can just encode this info like any other
-stream of data! The usual way to make an archive from several files is
-to use TAR, but this will generate a solid archive which will prevent
-partial recovery. An alternative is to use DAR, which is a non-solid
-archive version of TAR, with lots of other features too. If you also
-want to compress, you can just use ZIP (with DEFLATE algorithm) your
-files (this also generates a non-solid archive). You can then use
-pyFileFixity to generate an ecc file on your DAR or ZIP archive, which
-will then protect both your files just like before and the directories
-meta-data too now.
-
-Tools like pyFileFixity (or which can be used as complements)
--------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Here are some tools with a similar philosophy to pyFileFixity, which you
-can use if they better fit your needs, either as a replacement of
-pyFileFixity or as a complement (pyFileFixity can always be used to
-generate an ecc file):
-
--  `DAR (Disk ARchive) <http://dar.linux.free.fr/>`__: similar to tar
-   but non-solid thus allows for partial recovery and per-file access,
-   plus it saves the directory tree meta-data -- see catalog isolation
-   -- plus it can handle error correction natively using PAR2 and
-   encryption. Also supports incremental backup, thus it's a very nice
-   versatile tool. Crossplatform and opensource.
--  `DVDisaster <http://dvdisaster.net/>`__: error correction at the bit
-   level for optical mediums (CD, DVD and BD / BluRay Discs). Very good,
-   it also protects directory tree meta-data and is resilient to
-   corruption (v2 still has some critical spots but v3 won't have any).
--  rsbep tool that is part of dvbackup package in Debian: allows to
-   generate an ecc of a stream of bytes. Great to pipe to dar and/or gz
-   for your backups, if you're on unix or using cygwin.
--  `rsbep modification by Thanassis
-   Tsiodras <http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/rsbep.html>`__:
-   enhanced rsbep to avoid critical spots and faster speed. Also
-   includes a "freeze" script to encode your files into a virtual
-   filesystem (using Python/FUSE) so that even meta-data such as
-   directory tree are fully protected by the ecc. Great script, but not
-   maintained, it needs some intensive testing by someone knowledgeable
-   to guarantee this script is reliable enough for production.
--  Parchive (PAR1, PAR2, MultiPar): well known error correction file
-   generator. The big advantage of Parchives is that an ecc block
-   depends on multiple files: this allows to completely reconstruct a
-   missing file from scratch using files that are still available. Works
-   good for most people, but most available Parchive generators are not
-   satisfiable for me because 1- they do not allow to generate an ecc
-   for a directory tree recursively (except MultiPar, and even if it is
-   allowed in the PAR2 specs), 2- they can be very slow to generate
-   (even with multiprocessor extensions, because the galois field is
-   over 2^16 instead of 2^8, which is very costly), 3- the spec is not
-   very resilient to errors and tampering over the ecc file, as it
-   assumes the ecc file won't be corrupted (I also tested, it's still a
-   bit resilient, but it could be a lot more with some tweaking of the
-   spec), 4- it doesn't allow for partial recovery (recovering blocks
-   that we can and pass the others that are unrecoverable): with PAR2, a
-   file can be restored fully or it cannot be at all.
--  Zip (with DEFLATE algorithm, using 7-Zip or other tools): allows to
-   create non-solid archives which are readable by most computers
-   (ubiquitous algorithm). Non-solid archive means that a zip file can
-   still unzip correct files even if it is corrupted, because files are
-   encoded in blocks, and thus even if some blocks are corrupted, the
-   decoding can happen. A `fast implementation with enhanced compression
-   is available in pure Go <https://github.com/klauspost/compress>`__
-   (good for long storage).
--  TestDisk: for file scraping, when nothing else worked.
--  dd\_rescue: for disk scraping (allows to forcefully read a whole disk
-   at the bit level and copy everything it can, passing bad sector with
-   options to retry them later on after a first full pass over the
-   correct sectors).
--  ZFS: a file system which includes ecc correction directly. The whole
-   filesystem, including directory tree meta-data, are protected. If you
-   want ecc protection on your computer for all your files, this is the
-   way to go.
--  Encryption: technically, you can encrypt your files without losing
-   too much redundancy, as long as you use an encryption scheme that is
-   block-based such as DES: if one block gets corrupted, it won't be
-   decryptable, but the rest of the files' encrypted blocks should be
-   decryptable without any problem. So encrypting with such algorithms
-   leads to similar files as non-solid archives such as deflate zip. Of
-   course, for very long term storage, it's better to avoid encryption
-   and compression (because you raise the information contained in a
-   single block of data, thus if you lose one block, you lose more
-   data), but if it's really necessary to you, you can still maintain
-   high chances of recovering your files by using block-based
-   encryption/compression (note: block-based encryption can
-   be seen as the equivalent of non-solid archives for compression,
-   because the data is compressed/encrypted in independent blocks,
-   thus allowing partial uncompression/decryption).
--  `SnapRAID <http://snapraid.sourceforge.net/>`__
--  `par2ools <https://github.com/jmoiron/par2ools>`__: a set of
-   additional tools to manage par2 archives
--  `Checkm <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Checkm/0.4>`__: a tool similar
-   to rfigc.py
--  `BagIt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt>`__ with two python
-   implementations `here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybagit/>`__ and
-   `here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bagit/>`__: this is a file
-   packaging format for sharing and storing archives for long term
-   preservation, it just formalizes a few common procedures and meta
-   data that are usually added to files for long term archival (such as
-   MD5 digest).
--  `RSArmor <https://github.com/jap/rsarm>`__ a tool based on
-   Reed-Solomon to encode binary data files into hexadecimal, so that
-   you can print the characters on paper. May be interesting for small
-   datasets (below 100 MB).
--  `Ent <https://github.com/lsauer/entropy>`__ a tool to analyze the
-   entropy of your files. Can be very interesting to optimize the error
-   correction algorithm, or your compression tools.
--  `HashFS <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hashfs/>`_ is a non-redundant,
-   duplication free filesystem, in Python. **Data deduplication** is very
-   important for large scale long term storage: since you want your data
-   to be redundant, this means you will use an additional storage space
-   for your redundant copies that will be proportional to your original data.
-   Having duplicated data will consume more storage and more processing
-   time, for no benefit. That's why it's a good idea to deduplicate your data
-   prior to create redundant copies: this will be faster and save you money.
-   Deduplication can either be done manually (by using duplicates removers)
-   or systematically and automatically using specific filesystems such as
-   zfs (with deduplication enabled) or hashfs.
--  Paper as a storage medium: paper is not a great storage medium,
-   because it has low storage density (ie, you can only store at most 
-   about 100 KB) and it can also degrade just like other storage mediums,
-   but you cannot check that automatically since it's not digital. However,
-   if you are interested, here are a few softwares that do that:
-   `Paper key <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_key>`_,
-   `Paperbak <http://www.ollydbg.de/Paperbak/index.html>`_,
-   `Optar <http://ronja.twibright.com/optar/>`_,

-   `QR Backup (again) <http://hansmi.ch/software/qrbackup>`_,
-   `and finally a related paper <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.303.3101&rep=rep1&type=pdf>`_.
--  AVPreserve tools, most notably `fixity <https://github.com/avpreserve/fixity>`_ 
-   to monitor for file changes (similarly to rfigc, but actively as a daemon)
-   and `interstitial <https://github.com/avpreserve/interstitial>`_ to detect
-   interstitial errors in audio digitization workflows (great to ensure you
-   correctly digitized a whole audio file into WAV without any error).
-
-FAQ
----
-
--  Can I compress my data files and my ecc file?
-
-As a rule of thumb, you should ALWAYS keep your ecc file in clear
-text, so under no compression nor encryption. This is because in case
-the ecc file gets corrupted, if compressed/encrypted, the
-decompression/decrypting of the corrupted parts may completely flaw
-the whole structure of the ecc file.
-
-Your data files, that you want to protect, *should* remain in clear
-text, but you may choose to compress them if it drastically reduces
-the size of your files, and if you raise the resilience rate of your
-ecc file (so compression may be a good option if you have an
-opportunity to trade the file size reduction for more ecc file
-resilience). Also, make sure to choose a non-solid compression
-algorithm like DEFLATE (zip) so that you can still decode correct
-parts even if some are corrupted (else with a solid archive, if one
-byte is corrupted, the whole archive may become unreadable).
-
-However, in the case that you compress your files, you should generate
-the ecc file only *after* compression, so that the ecc file applies to
-the compressed archive instead of the uncompressed files, else you
-risk being unable to correct your files because the uncompression of
-corrupted parts may output gibberish, and length extended corrupted
-parts (and if the size is different, Reed-Solomon will just freak
-out).
-
--  Can I encrypt my data files and my ecc file ?
-
-NEVER encrypt your ecc file, this is totally useless and
-counterproductive.
-
-You can encrypt your data files, but choose a non-solid algorithm
-(like AES if I'm not mistaken) so that corrupted parts do not prevent
-the decoding of subsequent correct parts. Of course, you're lowering a
-bit your chances of recovering your data files by encrypting them (the
-best chance to keep data for the long term is to keep them in clear
-text), but if it's really necessary, using a non-solid encrypting
-scheme is a good compromise.
-
-You can generate an ecc file on your encrypted data files, thus
-*after* encryption, and keep the ecc file in clear text (never encrypt
-nor compress it). This is not a security risk at all since the ecc
-file does not give any information on the content inside your
-encrypted files, but rather just redundant info to correct corrupted
-bytes (however if you generate the ecc file on the data files before
-encryption, then it's clearly a security risk, and someone could
-recover your data without your permission).
-
-- What medium should I use to store my data?
-
-The details are long and a bit complicated (I may write a complete article
-about it in the future), but the tl;dr answer is that you should use *optical disks*,
-because it decouples the storage medium and the reading hardware
-(eg, at the opposite we have hard drives, which contains both the reading
-hardware and the storage medium, so if one fails, you lose both)
-and because it's most likely future-proof (you only need a laser, which
-is universal, the laser's parameters can always be tweaked).
-
-From scientific studies, it seems that, at the time of writing this (2015),
-BluRay HTL disks are the most resilient against environmental degradation.
-To raise the duration, you can also put optical disks in completely opaque boxes
-(to avoid light degradation) and in addition you can put any storage medium
-(not only optical disks, but also hard drives and anything really) in
-*completely* air-tight and water-tight bags or box and put in a fridge or a freezer.
-This is a law of nature: lower the temperature, lower will be the entropy, in other
-words lower will be the degradation over time. It works the same with digital data.
-
-- What file formats are the most recoverable?
-
-It's difficult to advise a specific format. What we can do is advise the characteristics
-of a good file format:
-
-  * future-proof (should be readable in the future).
-  * non-solid (ie, divised into indepedent blocks, so that a corruption to one block doesn't cause a problem to the decoding of other blocks).
-  * open source implementation available.
-  * minimize corruption impact (ie, how much of the file becomes unreadable with a partial corruption? Only the partially corrupted area, or other valid parts too?).
-  * No magic bytes or header importance (ie, corrupting the header won't prevent opening the file).
-
-There are a few studies about the most resilient file formats, such as:
-
-  * `"Just one bit in a million: On the effects of data corruption in files" by Volker Heydegger <http://lekythos.library.ucy.ac.cy/bitstream/handle/10797/13919/ECDL038.pdf?sequence=1>`_.
-  * `"Analysing the impact of file formats on data integrity" by Volker Heydegger <http://old.hki.uni-koeln.de/people/herrmann/forschung/heydegger_archiving2008_40.pdf>`_.
-  * `"A guide to formats", by The UK national archives <http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/guide-to-formats.pdf>`_ (you want to look at the Recoverability entry in each table).
-
-- What is Reed-Solomon?
-
-If you have any question about Reed-Solomon codes, the best place to ask is probably here (with the incredible Dilip Sarwate): http://www.dsprelated.com/groups/comp.dsp/1.php?searchfor=reed%20solomon
-
-Also, you may want to read the following resources:
-
-  * "`Reed-Solomon codes for coders <https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_codes_for_coders>`_", free practical beginner's tutorial with Python code examples on WikiVersity. Partially written by one of the authors of the present software.
-  * "Algebraic codes for data transmission", Blahut, Richard E., 2003, Cambridge university press. `Readable online on Google Books <https://books.google.fr/books?id=eQs2i-R9-oYC&lpg=PR11&ots=atCPQJm3OJ&dq=%22Algebraic%20codes%20for%20data%20transmission%22%2C%20Blahut%2C%20Richard%20E.%2C%202003%2C%20Cambridge%20university%20press.&lr&hl=fr&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q=%22Algebraic%20codes%20for%20data%20transmission%22,%20Blahut,%20Richard%20E.,%202003,%20Cambridge%20university%20press.&f=false>`_.

+
+The project is done in pure-Python to meet those criteria,

+which equals to 5 bytes corrupted in total, over 19KB which is the total file size).
+Only a few corrupted bytes are enough to make the image looks like totally
+unrecoverable, and yet we are lucky, because the image could be unreadable at all
+if any of the "magic bytes" were to be corrupted!
+
+At the right, the corrupted image was repaired using `header_ecc.py` of pyFileFixity.
+This repaired only the image header (ie, the first part of the file), so only the first
+3 corrupted bytes were repaired, not the 2 bytes in the rest of the file, but we can see
+the image looks like it's totally repaired! And the best thing is that it only costed the generation
+of a "ecc repair file", which size is only 3.3KB (17% of the original file)!
+
+This works because most files will store the most important information to read them at
+their beginning, also called "file's header", so repairing this part will almost always ensure
+the possibility to read the file (even if the rest of the file is still corrupted, if the header is safe,
+you can read it).
+
+Of course, you can also protect the whole file, not only the header, using pyFileFixity's
+`structural_adaptive_ecc.py`. You can also detect any corruption using `rfigc.py`.

+
+Quickstart
+----------
+
+Runs on Python 3 up to Python 3.11. Both PyPy 3 and PyPy 2 are supported. Older versions such as Python 2.7.10 are still being automatically unit tested with continuous integration but support can be dropped at any moment.
+
+- To install or update on Python 3:
+
+``pip install --upgrade pyfilefixity``
+
+- For Python 2.7, the latest working version was v3.0.2:
+
+``pip install --upgrade pyfilefixity==3.0.2 reedsolo==1.7.0 unireedsolomon==1.0.5``
+
+- Once installed, the suite of tools can be accessed from a centralized interface script called ``pff`` which provides several subcommands, to list them:
+
+``pff --help``
+
+You should see:
+
+::
+
+    usage: pff [-h]
+               {hash,rfigc,header,header_ecc,hecc,whole,structural_adaptive_ecc,saecc,protect,repair,recover,repair_ecc,recc,dup,replication_repair,restest,resilience_tester,filetamper,speedtest,ecc_speedtest}
+               ...
+
+    positional arguments:
+      {hash,rfigc,header,header_ecc,hecc,whole,structural_adaptive_ecc,saecc,protect,repair,recover,repair_ecc,recc,dup,replication_repair,restest,resilience_tester,filetamper,speedtest,ecc_speedtest}

+                            Protect/repair whole files with error correction codes
+        recover (repair_ecc, recc)
+                            Utility to try to recover damaged ecc files using a failsafe mechanism, a sort of recovery
+                            mode (note: this does NOT recover your files, only the ecc files, which may then be used to
+                            recover your files!)
+        dup (replication_repair)
+                            Repair files from multiple copies of various storage mediums using a majority vote
+        restest (resilience_tester)
+                            Run tests to quantify robustness of a file protection scheme (can be used on any, not just
+                            pyFileFixity)
+        filetamper          Tamper files using various schemes

+
+    options:
+      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
+
+- Every subcommands provide their own more detailed help instructions, eg for the ``hash`` submodule:
+
+``pff hash --help``
+
+- To generate a monitoring database (to later check very fast which files are corrupted, but cannot repair anything but filesystem metadata):
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -g -f -l "log.txt"``
+
+Note: this also works for a single file, just replace "your_folder" by "your_file.ext".
+
+- Later, to check which files were corrupted:
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -l log.txt -s -e errors.csv``
+
+- To use this monitoring database to recover filesystem metadata such as files names and directory layout by filescraping from files contents:
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -l "log.txt" -o "output_folder" --filescraping_recovery``
+
+- To protect files headers with a file called ``hecc.txt``:
+
+``pff header -i "your_folder" -d "hecc.txt" -l "log.txt" -g -f --ecc_algo 3``
+
+- To repair files headers and store the repaired files in ``output_folder``:
+
+``pff header -i "your_folder" -d "hecc.txt" -o "output_folder" -l "log.txt" -c -v --ecc_algo 3``
+
+- To protect whole files with a file called ``ecc.txt``:
+
+``pff whole -i "your_folder" -d "ecc.txt" -l "log.txt" -g -f -v --ecc_algo 3``
+
+- To repair whole files:
+
+``pff whole -i "your_folder" -d "ecc.txt" -o "output_folder" -l "log.txt" -c -v --ecc_algo 3``
+
+Note that ``header`` and ``whole`` can also detect corrupted files and even which blocks inside a file, but they are much slower than ``hash``.
+
+- To try to recover a damaged ecc file ``ecc.txt`` using an index file ``ecc.txt.idx`` (index file is generated automatically with ecc.txt):
+
+``pff recovery -i "ecc.txt" --index "ecc.txt.idx" -o "ecc_repaired.txt" -l "log.txt" -v -f``
+
+- To try to recover a damaged ecc file ``ecc.txt`` without an index file (you can tweak the ``-t`` parameter from 0.0 to 1.0, 1.0 producing many false positives):
+
+``pff recovery -i "ecc.txt" -o "ecc_repaired.txt" -l "log.txt" -v -f -t 0.4``
+
+- To repair your files using multiple duplicated copies that you have stored on different mediums:
+
+``pff dup -i "path/to/dir1" "path/to/dir2" "path/to/dir3" -o "path/to/output" --report "rlog.csv" -f -v``
+
+- If you have previously generated a rfigc database, you can use it to enhance the replication repair:
+
+``pff dup -i "path/to/dir1" "path/to/dir2" "path/to/dir3" -o "path/to/output" -d "dbhash.csv" --report "rlog.csv" -f -v``
+
+- To run tests on your recovery tools, you can make a Makefile-like configuration file and use the Resiliency Tester submodule:
+
+``pff restest -i "your_folder" -o "test_folder" -c "resiliency_tester_config.txt" -m 3 -l "testlog.txt" -f``
+
+- Internally, ``pff restest`` uses ``pff filetamper`` to tamper files with various schemes, but you can also use ``pff filetamper`` directly.
+
+- To run speedtests of encoding/decoding error correction codes on your machine:
+
+``pff speedtest``
+
+- In case the ``pff`` command does not work, it can be replaced with ``python -m pyFileFixity.pff`` .
+
+- DEPRECATED (because Gooey is not maintained anymore it seems): To use the GUI with any tool, use ``--gui`` and do not supply any other argument, eg: ``python rfigc.py --gui``.
+
+- You can also use `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_ or Cython to hugely speedup the processing time of any tool here.
+
+The problem of long term storage
+--------------------------------
+
+Why are data corrupted with time? One sole reason: entropy.
+Entropy refers to the universal tendency for systems to become
+less ordered over time. Data corruption is exactly that: a disorder
+in bits order. In other words: *the Universe hates your data*.
+
+Long term storage is thus a very difficult topic: it's like fighting with
+death (in this case, the death of data). Indeed, because of entropy,
+data will eventually fade away because of various silent errors such as
+bit rot or cosmic rays. pyFileFixity aims to provide tools to detect any data
+corruption, but also fight data corruption by providing repairing tools.
+
+The only solution is to use a principle of engineering that is long
+known and which makes bridges and planes safe: add some **redundancy**.
+
+There are only 2 ways to add redundancy:
+
+-  the simple way is to **duplicate** the object (also called replication),
+   but for data storage, this eats up a lot of storage and is not optimal.
+   However, if storage is cheap, then this is a good solution, as it is
+   much faster than encoding with error correction codes. For replication to work,
+   at least 3 duplicates are necessary at all times, so that if one fails, it must
+   replaced asap. As sailors say: "Either bring 1 compass or 3 compasses, but never
+   two, because then you won't know which one is correct if one fails."
+   Indeed, with 3 duplicates, if you frequently monitor their integrity
+   (eg, with hashes), then if one fails, simply do a majority vote:
+   the bit value given by 2 of the duplicates is probably correct.
+-  the second way, the optimal tools ever invented to recover
+   from data corruption, are the **error correction codes** (forward
+   error correction), which are a way to smartly produce redundant codes
+   from your data so that you can later repair your data using these
+   additional pieces of information (ie, an ECC generates n blocks for a
+   file cut in k blocks (with k < n), and then the ecc code can rebuild
+   the whole file with (at least) any k blocks among the total n blocks
+   available). In other words, you can correct up to (n-k) erasures. But
+   error correcting codes can also detect and repair automatically where
+   the errors are (fully automatic data repair for you !), but at the
+   cost that you can then only correct (n-k)/2 errors.
+
+Error correction can seem a bit magical, but for a reasonable intuition,
+it can be seen as a way to average the corruption error rate: on
+average, a bit will still have the same chance to be corrupted, but
+since you have more bits to represent the same data, you lower the
+overall chance to lose this bit.
+
+The problem is that most theoretical and pratical works on error
+correcting codes has been done almost exclusively on channel
+transmission (such as 4G, internet, etc.), but not on data storage,
+which is very different for one reason: whereas in a channel we are in a
+spatial scheme (both the sender and the receiver are different entities
+in space but working at the same timescale), in data storage this is a
+temporal scheme: the sender was you storing the data on your medium at
+time t, and the receiver is again you but now retrieving the data at
+time t+x. Thus, the sender does not exist anymore, thus you cannot ask
+the sender to send again some data if it's too much corrupted: in data
+storage, if a data is corrupted, it's lost for good, whereas in channel theory,
+parts of the data can be submitted again if necessary.
+
+Some attempts were made to translate channel theory and error correcting
+codes theory to data storage, the first being Reed-Solomon which spawned
+the RAID schema. Then CIRC (Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding) was
+devised for use on optical discs to recover from scratches, which was
+necessary for the technology to be usable for consumers. Since then, new
+less-optimal but a lot faster algorithms such as LDPC, turbo-codes and
+fountain codes such as RaptorQ were invented (or rediscovered), but they
+are still marginally researched for data storage.
+
+This project aims to, first, implement easy tools to evaluate strategies
+(filetamper.py) and file fixity (ie, detect if there are corruptions),
+and then the goal is to provide an open and easy framework to use
+different kinds of error correction codes to protect and repair files.
+
+Also, the ecc file specification is made to be simple and resilient to
+corruption, so that you can process it by your own means if you want to,
+without having to study for hours how the code works (contrary to PAR2
+format).
+
+In practice, both approaches are not exclusive, and the best is to
+combine them: protect the most precious data with error correction codes,
+then duplicate them as well as less sensitive data across multiple storage mediums.
+Hence, this suite of data protection tools, just like any other such suite, is not
+sufficient to guarantee your data is protected, you must have an active data curation
+strategy which includes regularly checking your data and replacing copies that are damaged.
+
+For a primer on storage mediums and data protection strategies, see `this post I wrote <https://web.archive.org/web/20220529125543/https://superuser.com/questions/374609/what-medium-should-be-used-for-long-term-high-volume-data-storage-archival/873260>`_.
+
+Why not just use RAID ?
+-----------------------
+
+RAID is clearly insufficient for long-term data storage, and in fact it
+was primarily meant as a cheap way to get more storage (RAID0) or more
+availability (RAID1) of data, not for archiving data, even on a medium
+timescale:
+
+-  RAID 0 is just using multiple disks just like a single one, to extend
+   the available storage. Let's skip this one.
+-  RAID 1 is mirroring one disk with a bit-by-bit copy of another disk.
+   That's completely useless for long term storage: if either disk
+   fails, or if both disks are partially corrupted, you can't know what
+   are the correct data and which aren't. As an old saying goes: "Never
+   take 2 compasses: either take 3 or 1, because if both compasses show
+   different directions, you will never know which one is correct, nor
+   if both are wrong." That's the principle of Triplication.
+-  RAID 5 is based on the triplication idea: you have n disks (but least
+   3), and if one fails you can recover n-1 disks (resilient to only 1
+   disk failure, not more).
+-  RAID 6 is an extension of RAID 5 which is closer to error-correction
+   since you can correct n-k disks. However, most (all?) currently
+   commercially available RAID6 devices only implements recovery for at
+   most n-2 (2 disks failures).
+-  In any case, RAID cannot detect silent errors automatically, thus you
+   either have to regularly scan, or you risk to lose some of your data
+   permanently, and it's far more common than you can expect (eg, with
+   RAID5, it is enough to have 2 silent errors on two disks on the same
+   bit for the bit to be unrecoverable). That's why a limit of only 1 or
+   2 disks failures is just not enough.
+
+On the opposite, ECC can correct n-k disks (or files). You can configure
+n and k however you want, so that for example you can set k = n/2, which
+means that you can recover all your files from only half of them! (once
+they are encoded with an ecc file of course).
+
+There also are new generation RAID solutions, mainly software based,
+such as SnapRAID or ZFS, which allow you to configure a virtual RAID
+with the value n-k that you want. This is just like an ecc file (but a
+bit less flexible, since it's not a file but a disk mapping, so that you
+can't just copy it around or upload it to a cloud backup hosting). In
+addition to recover (n-k) disks, they can also be configured to recover
+from partial, sectors failures inside the disk and not just the whole
+disk (for a more detailed explanation, see Plank, James S., Mario Blaum,
+and James L. Hafner. "SD codes: erasure codes designed for how storage
+systems really fail." FAST. 2013.).
+
+The other reason RAID is not adapted to long-term storage, is that it
+supposes you store your data on hard-drives exclusively. Hard drives
+aren't a good storage medium for the long term, for two reasons:
+
+| 1- they need a regular plug to keep the internal magnetic disks
+  electrified (else the data will just fade away when there's no
+  residual electricity).
+| 2- the reading instrument is directly included and merged with the
+  data (this is the green electronic board you see from the outside, and
+  the internal head). This is good for quick consumer use (don't need to
+  buy another instrument: the HDD can just be plugged and it works), but
+  it's very bad for long term storage, because the reading instrument is
+  bound to fail, and a lot faster than the data can fade away: this
+  means that even if your magnetic disks inside your HDD still holds
+  your data, if the controller board or the head doesn't work anymore,
+  your data is just lost. And a head (and a controller board) are almost
+  impossible to replace, even by professionals, because the pieces are
+  VERY hard to find (different for each HDD production line) and each
+  HDD has some small physical defects, thus it's impossible to reproduce
+  that too (because the head is so close to the magnetic disk that if
+  you try to do that manually you'll probably fail).
+
+In the end, it's a lot better to just separate the storage medium of
+data, with the reading instrument. The medium I advise is optical disks
+(whether it's BluRay, DVD, CD or whatever), because the reading
+instrument is separate, and the technology (laser reflecting on bumps
+and/or pits) is kind of universal, so that even if the technology is
+lost one day (deprecated by newer technologies, so that you can't find
+the reading instrument anymore because it's not sold anymore), you can
+probably emulate a laser using some software to read your optical disk,
+just like what the CAMiLEON project did to recover data from the
+LaserDiscs of the BBC Domesday Project (see Wikipedia).
+
+Applications included
+---------------------
+
+The project currently include the following pure-python applications:
+
+-  rfigc.py (subcommand: ``hash``), a hash auditing tool, similar to md5deep/hashdeep, to
+   compute a database of your files along with their metadata, so that
+   later you can check if they were changed/corrupted.
+
+-  header\_ecc.py (subcommand: ``header``), an error correction code using Reed-Solomon
+   generator/corrector for files headers. The idea is to supplement
+   other more common redundancy tools such as PAR2 (which is quite
+   reliable), by adding more resiliency only on the critical parts of
+   the files: their headers. Using this script, you can significantly
+   higher the chance of recovering headers, which will allow you to at
+   least open the files.
+
+-  structural\_adaptive\_ecc.py (subcommand: ``whole``), a variable error correction rate
+   encoder (kind of a generalization of header\_ecc.py). This script
+   allows to generate an ecc file for the whole content of your files,
+   not just the header part, using a variable resilience rate: the
+   header part will be the most protected, then the rest of each file
+   will be progressively encoded with a smaller and smaller resilience
+   rate. The assumption is that important information is stored first,
+   and then data becomes less and less informative (and thus important,
+   because the end of the file describes less important details). This
+   assumption is very true for all compressed kinds of formats, such as
+   JPG, ZIP, Word, ODT, etc...
+
+-  repair\_ecc.py (subcommand: ``recovery``), a script to repair the structure (ie, the entry and
+   fields markers/separators) of an ecc file generated by header\_ecc.py
+   or structural\_adaptive\_ecc.py. The goal is to enhance the
+   resilience of ecc files against corruption by ensuring that their
+   structures can be repaired (up to a certain point which is very high
+   if you use an index backup file, which is a companion file that is
+   generated along an ecc file).
+
+-  filetamper.py (subcommand: ``filetamper``) is a quickly made file corrupter, it will erase or
+   change characters in the specified file. This is useful for testing
+   your various protecting strategies and file formats (eg: is PAR2
+   really resilient against corruption? Are zip archives still partially
+   extractable after corruption or are rar archives better? etc.). Do
+   not underestimate the usefulness of this tool, as you should always
+   check the resiliency of your file formats and of your file protection
+   strategies before relying on them.
+
+-  replication\_repair.py (subcommand: ``dup``) takes advantage of your multiple copies
+   (replications) of your data over several storage mediums to recover
+   your data in case it gets corrupted. The goal is to take advantage of
+   the storage of your archived files into multiple locations: you will
+   necessarily make replications, so why not use them for repair?
+   Indeed, it's good practice to keep several identical copies of your data
+   on several storage mediums, but in case a corruption happens,
+   usually you will just drop the corrupted copies and keep the intacts ones.
+   However, if all copies are partially corrupted, you're stuck. This script
+   aims to take advantage of these multiple copies to recover your data,
+   without generating a prior ecc file. It works simply by reading through all
+   your different copies of your data, and it casts a majority vote over each
+   byte: the one that is the most often occuring will be kept. In engineering,
+   this is a very common strategy used for very reliable systems such as
+   space rockets, and is called "triple-modular redundancy", because you need
+   at least 3 copies of your data for the majority vote to work (but the more the
+   better).
+
+-  resiliency\_tester.py (subcommand: ``restest``) allows you to test the robustness of the
+   corruption correction of the scripts provided here (or any other
+   command-line app). You just have to copy the files you want to test inside a
+   folder, and then the script will copy the files into a test tree, then it
+   will automatically corrupt the files randomly (you can change the parameters
+   like block burst and others), then it will run the file repair command-lines
+   you supply and finally some stats about the repairing power will be
+   generated. This allows you to easily and objectively compare different set
+   of parameters, or even different file repair solutions, on the very data
+   that matters to you, so that you can pick the best option for you.
+
+-  ecc\_speedtest.py (subcommand: ``speedtest``) is a simple error correction codes
+   encoder/decoder speedtest. It allows to easily change parameters for the test.
+   This allows to assess how fast your machine can encode/decode with the selected
+   parameters, which can be especially useful to plan ahead for how many files you
+   can reasonably plan to protect with error correction codes (which are time consuming).
+
+-  DEPRECATED: easy\_profiler.py is just a quick and simple profiling tool to get
+   you started quickly on what should be optimized to get more speed, if
+   you want to contribute to the project feel free to propose a pull
+   request! (Cython and other optimizations are welcome as long as they
+   are cross-platform and that an alternative pure-python implementation
+   is also available).
+
+Note that all tools are primarily made for command-line usage (type
+script.py --help to get extended info about the accepted arguments), but
+you can also use rfigc.py and header\_ecc.py with a GUI by using the
+--gui argument (must be the first and only one argument supplied). The
+GUI is provided as-is and minimal work will be done to maintain it (the
+focus will stay on functionality rather than ergonomy).
+
+IMPORTANT: it is CRITICAL that you use the same parameters for
+correcting mode as when you generated the database/ecc files (this is
+true for all scripts in this bundle). Of course, some options must be
+changed: -g must become -c to correct, and --update is a particular
+case. This works this way on purpose for mainly two reasons: first
+because it is very hard to autodetect the parameters from a database
+file alone and it would produce lots of false positives, and secondly
+(the primary reason) is that storing parameters inside the database file
+is highly unresilient against corruption (if this part of the database
+is tampered, the whole becomes unreadable, while if they are stored
+outside or in your own memory, the database file is always accessible).
+Thus, it is advised to write down the parameters you used to generate
+your database directly on the storage media you will store your database
+file on (eg: if it's an optical disk, write the parameters on the cover
+or directly on the disk using a marker), or better memorize them by
+heart. If you forget them, don't panic, the parameters are always stored
+as comments in the header of the generated ecc files, but you should try
+to store them outside of the ecc files anyway.
+
+For users: what's the advantage of pyFileFixity?
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Pros:
+
+-  Open application and open specifications under the MIT license (you
+   can do whatever you want with it and tailor it to your needs if you
+   want to, or add better decoding procedures in the future as science
+   progress so that you can better recover your data from your already
+   generated ecc file).
+-  Highly reliable file fixity watcher: rfigc.py will tell you without
+   any ambiguity using several attributes if your files have been
+   corrupted or not, and can even check for images if the header is
+   valid (ie: if the file can still be opened).
+-  Readable ecc file format (compared to PAR2 and most other similar
+   specifications).
+-  Highly resilient ecc file format against corruption (not only are
+   your data protected by ecc, the ecc file is protected too against
+   critical spots, both because there is no header so that each track is
+   independent and if one track is corrupted beyond repair then other
+   ecc tracks can still be read, and a .idx file will be generated to
+   repair the structure of the ecc file to recover all tracks).
+-  Very safe and conservative approach: the recovery process checks that
+   the recovery was successful before committing a repaired block.
+-  Partial recovery allowed (even if a file cannot be completely
+   recovered, the parts that can will be repaired and then the rest that
+   can't be repaired will be recopied from the corrupted version).
+-  Support directory processing: you can encode an ecc file for a whole
+   directory of files (with any number of sub-directories and depth).
+-  No limit on the number of files, and it can recursively protect files
+   in a directory tree.
+-  Variable resiliency rate and header-only resilience, ensuring that
+   you can always open your files even if partially corrupted (the
+   structure of your files will be saved, so that you can use other
+   softwares to repair beyond if this set of script is not sufficient to
+   totally repair).
+-  Support for erasures (null bytes) and even errors-and-erasures, which
+   literally doubles the repair capabilities. To my knowledge, this is
+   the only freely available parity software that supports erasures.
+-  Display the predicted total ecc file size given your parameters,
+   and the total time it will take to encode/decode.
+-  Your original files are still accessible as they are, protection files
+   such as ecc files live alongside your original data. Contrary to
+   other data protection schemes such as PAR2 which encode the whole
+   data in par archive files that replace your original files and
+   are not readable without decoding.
+-  Opensourced under the very permissive MIT licence, do whatever you
+   want!
+
+Cons:
+
+-  Cannot protect meta-data, such as folders paths. The paths are
+   stored, but cannot be recovered (yet? feel free to contribute if you
+   know how). Only files are protected. Thus if your OS or your storage
+   medium crashes and truncate a whole directory tree, the directory
+   tree can't be repaired using the ecc file, and thus you can't access
+   the files neither. However, you can use file scraping to extract the
+   files even if the directory tree is lost, and then use RFIGC.py to
+   reorganize your files correctly. There are alternatives, see the
+   chapters below: you can either package all your files in a single
+   archive using DAR or ZIP (thus the ecc will also protect meta-data), or see
+   DVDisaster as an alternative solution, which is an ecc generator with
+   support for directory trees meta-data (but only on optical disks).
+-  Can only repair errors and erasures (characters that are replaced by
+   another character), not deletion nor insertion of characters. However
+   this should not happen with any storage medium (truncation can occur
+   if the file bounds is misdetected, in this case pyFileFixity can
+   partially repair the known parts of the file, but cannot recover the
+   rest past the truncation, except if you used a resiliency rate of at
+   least 0.5, in which case any message block can be recreated with only
+   using the ecc file).
+-  Cannot recreate a missing file from other available files (except you
+   have set a resilience\_rate at least 0.5), contrary to Parchives
+   (PAR1/PAR2). Thus, you can only repair a file if you still have it
+   (and its ecc file!) on your filesystem. If it's missing, pyFileFixity
+   cannot do anything (yet, this will be implemented in the future).
+
+Note that the tools were meant for data archival (protect files that you
+won't modify anymore), not for system's files watching nor to protect
+all the files on your computer. To do this, you can use a filesystem
+that directly integrate error correction code capacity, such as ZFS.
+
+Recursive/Relative Files Integrity Generator and Checker in Python (aka RFIGC)
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Recursively generate or check the integrity of files by MD5 and SHA1
+hashes, size, modification date or by data structure integrity (only for
+images).
+
+This script is originally meant to be used for data archival, by
+allowing an easy way to check for silent file corruption. Thus, this
+script uses relative paths so that you can easily compute and check the
+same redundant data copied on different mediums (hard drives, optical
+discs, etc.). This script is not meant for system files corruption
+notification, but is more meant to be used from times-to-times to check
+up on your data archives integrity (if you need this kind of application,
+see `avpreserve's fixity <https://github.com/avpreserve/fixity>`_).
+
+Example usage
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+-  To generate the database (only needed once):
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -g``
+
+-  To check:
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -l log.txt -s``
+
+-  To update your database by appending new files:
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a``
+
+-  To update your database by appending new files AND removing
+   inexistent files:
+
+``pff hash -i "your_folder" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a -r``
+
+Note that by default, the script is by default in check mode, to avoid
+wrong manipulations. It will also alert you if you generate over an
+already existing database file.
+
+Arguments
+~~~~~~~~~

+
+Header Error Correction Code script
+-----------------------------------
+
+This script was made to be used in combination with other more common
+file redundancy generators (such as PAR2, I advise MultiPar). This is an
+additional layer of protection for your files: by using a higher
+resiliency rate on the headers of your files, you ensure that you will
+be probably able to open them in the future, avoiding the "critical
+spots", also called "fracture-critical" in redundancy engineering (where
+if you modify just one bit, your whole file may become unreadable,
+usually bits residing in the headers - in other words, a single blow
+makes the whole thing collapse, just like non-redundant bridges).
+
+An interesting benefit of this approach is that it has a low storage
+(and computational) overhead that scales linearly to the number of
+files, whatever their size is: for example, if we have a set of 40k
+files for a total size of 60 GB, with a resiliency\_rate of 30% and
+header\_size of 1KB (we limit to the first 1K bytes/characters = our
+file header), then, without counting the hash per block and other
+meta-data, the final ECC file will be about 2 \* resiliency\_rate \*
+number\_of\_files \* header\_size = 24.5 MB. This size can be lower if
+there are many files smaller than 1KB. This is a pretty low storage
+overhead to backup the headers of such a big number of files.
+
+The script is pure-python as are its dependencies: it is thus completely
+cross-platform and open source. However, this imply that it is quite
+slow, but PyPy v2.5.0 was successfully tested against the script without
+any modification, and a speed increase of more 100x could be observed,
+so that you can expect a rate of more than 1MB/s, which is quite fast.
+
+Structural Adaptive Error Correction Encoder
+--------------------------------------------
+
+This script implements a variable error correction rate encoder: each
+file is ecc encoded using a variable resiliency rate -- using a high
+constant resiliency rate for the header part (resiliency rate stage 1,
+high), then a variable resiliency rate is applied to the rest of the
+file's content, with a higher rate near the beginning of the file
+(resiliency rate stage 2, medium) which progressively decreases until
+the end of file (resiliency rate stage 3, the lowest).
+
+The idea is that the critical parts of files usually are placed at the
+top, and data becomes less and less critical along the file. What is
+meant by critical is both the critical spots (eg: if you tamper only one
+character of a file's header you have good chances of losing your entire
+file, ie, you cannot even open it) and critically encoded information
+(eg: archive formats usually encode compressed symbols as they go along
+the file, which means that the first occurrence is encoded, and then the
+archive simply writes a reference to the symbol. Thus, the first
+occurrence is encoded at the top, and subsequent encoding of this same
+data pattern will just be one symbol, and thus it matters less as long
+as the original symbol is correctly encoded and its information
+preserved, we can always try to restore the reference symbols later).
+Moreover, really redundant data will be placed at the top because they
+can be reused a lot, while data that cannot be too much compressed will
+be placed later, and thus, corruption of this less compressed data is a
+lot less critical because only a few characters will be changed in the
+uncompressed file (since the data is less compressed, a character change
+on the not-so-much compressed data won't have very significant impact on
+the uncompressed data).
+
+This variable error correction rate should allow to protect more the
+critical parts of a file (the header and the beginning of a file, for
+example in compressed file formats such as zip or jpg this is where the
+most importantly strings are encoded) for the same amount of storage as
+a standard constant error correction rate.
+
+Of course, you can set the resiliency rate for each stage to the values
+you want, so that you can even do the opposite: setting a higher
+resiliency rate for stage 3 than stage 2 will produce an ecc that is
+greater towards the end of the contents of your files.
+
+Furthermore, the currently designed format of the ecc file would allow
+two things that are not available in all current file ecc generators
+such as PAR2:
+
+1. it allows to partially repair a file, even if not all
+the blocks can be corrected (in PAR2, a file is repaired only if all
+blocks can be repaired, which is a shame because there are still other
+blocks that could be repaired and thus produce a less corrupted file) ;
+
+2. the ecc file format is quite simple and readable, easy to process by
+any script, which would allow other softwares to also work on it (and it
+was also done in this way to be more resilient against error
+corruptions, so that even if an entry is corrupted, other entries are
+independent and can maybe be used, thus the ecc is very error tolerant.
+This idea was implemented in repair\_ecc.py but it could be extended,
+especially if you know the pattern of the corruption).
+
+The script structural-adaptive-ecc.py implements this idea, which can be
+seen as an extension of header-ecc.py (and in fact the idea was the
+other way around: structural-adaptive-ecc.py was conceived first but was
+too complicated, then header-ecc.py was implemented as a working
+lessened implementation only for headers, and then
+structural-adaptive-ecc.py was finished using header-ecc.py code
+progress). It works, it was a quite well tested for my own needs on
+datasets of hundred of GB, but it's not foolproof so make sure you test
+the script by yourself to see if it's robust enough for your needs (any
+feedback about this would be greatly appreciated!).
+
+ECC Algorithms
+--------------
+
+You can specify different ecc algorithms using the ``--ecc_algo`` switch.
+
+For the moment, only Reed-Solomon is implemented, but it's universal
+so you can modify its parameters in lib/eccman.py.
+
+Two Reed-Solomon codecs are available, they are functionally equivalent
+and thoroughly unit tested.
+
+-  ``--ecc_algo 1``: use the first Reed-Solomon codec in galois field 2^8 of root 3 with fcr=1.
+   This is the slowest implementation (but also the most easy code to understand).
+-  ``--ecc_algo 2``: same as algo 1 but with a faster functions.
+-  ``--ecc_algo 3``: use the second codec, which is the fastest.
+   The generated ECC will be compatible with algo 1 and 2.
+-  ``--ecc_algo 4``: also use the second, fastest RS codec, but
+   with different parameters (US FAA ADSB UAT RS FEC norm),
+   thus the generated ECC won't be compatible with algo 1 to 3.
+   But do not be scared, the ECC will work just the same.
+
+Cython implementation
+---------------------
+
+This section describes how to use the Cython implementation. However,
+you should first try PyPy, as it may give great performances too.
+
+Simply follow the instruction to install the `reedsolo <https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/reedsolomon>`_ module with
+the cythonized module.
+
+Then make sure to use ``ecc_algo=3`` in all your ``eccman`` calls, and you
+are then good to go, the cythonized module ``creedsolo`` will always be used
+for both encoding and decoding transparently.
+
+THE REST OF THIS SECTION IS OLD AND DEPRECATED, because the Cython compilation is now
+done directly in the Reed-Solomon submodules, instead of here, so you
+should not need to worry about it, just pip install with the requirements.txt
+and you should be set. The information below is left for historical purposes:
+
+A speedy Cython implementation of the Reed-Solomon library is included.
+It should provide C-speed for all scripts (as long as you use
+--ecc\_algo 1 or 2, not 3 nor 4). It is not needed, since a pure-python
+implementation is used by default, but it can be useful if you want to
+encode big datasets of several hundred of GB.
+
+If you want to build the C/Cython implementation, do the following:
+
+1- Install a C compiler for your platform. On Linux, gcc should already
+be installed. On Windows, you need to use the Visual Studio C compiler
+(not MinGW nor Cygwin gcc, they won't work). You can use the "Microsoft
+Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7", and follow these instructions to
+make it work if you have Python < 2.7.10:
+
+https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/CythonExtensionsOnWindows
+
+2- cd to this folder (where pyFileFixity resides), and execute the
+following command:
+
+``python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=msvc``
+
+If everything goes alright, the C compiler will compile the .c files
+(that were pre-generated by Cython) and you can then use PyFileFixity
+scripts just as usual and you should see a huge speedup. Else, if it
+doesn't work, you might need to generate .c files using Cython for your
+platform (because the pre-generated .c files may be incompatible with
+your platform). To do that, you just need to install Cython, which is an
+easy task with nowadays Python distributions such as Anaconda: download
+32-bit Anaconda installer (on Windows you should avoid the 64-bit, it
+may produce weird issues with Cython), then after install, open the
+Anaconda Command Prompt and execute: ``conda install cython``. This will
+install all the necessary stuff along the cython library. Then you can
+simply execute again the command
+``python setup.py build_ext --inplace --compiler=msvc`` and it will this
+time rebuild from scratch, by autodetecting that you have Cython
+installed, the setup.py script will automatically generate .c files from
+.pyx files and then .pyd files (binaries) from .c files.
+
+If you get issues, you can see the following post on how to install
+Cython:
+
+https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/InstallingOnWindows
+
+3- You can now launch pyFileFixity like usual, it should automatically
+detect the C/Cython compiled files and use that to speedup processing.
+
+Note about speed: Also, use a smaller --max\_block\_size to greatly
+speedup the operations! That's the trick used to compute very quickly RS
+ECC on optical discs. You give up a bit of resiliency of course (because
+blocks are smaller, thus you protect a smaller number of characters per
+ECC. In the end, this should not change much about real resiliency, but
+in case you get a big bit error burst on a contiguous block, you may
+lose a whole block at once. That's why using RS255 is better, but it's
+very time consuming. However, the resiliency ratios still hold, so for
+any other case of bit-flipping with average-sized bursts, this should
+not be a problem as long as the size of the bursts is smaller than an
+ecc block.)
+
+In case of a catastrophic event
+-------------------------------
+
+TODO: write more here
+
+In case of a catastrophic event of your data due to the failure of your
+storage media (eg: your hard drive crashed), then follow the following
+steps:
+
+1- use dd\_rescue to make a full bit-per-bit verbatim copy of your drive
+before it dies. The nice thing with dd\_rescue is that the copy is
+exact, and also that it can retries or skip in case of bad sectors (it
+won't crash on your suddenly at half the process).
+
+2- Use testdisk to restore partition or to copy files based on partition
+filesystem informations.
+
+3- If you could not recover your files, you can try file scraping using
+`photorec <http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec>`_ or
+`plaso  <http://plaso.kiddaland.net/>`_ other similar tools as
+a last resort to extract data based only from files content (no filename,
+often uncorrect filetype, file boundaries may be wrong so some data
+may be cut off, etc.).
+
+4- If you used pyFileFixity before the failure of your storage media,
+you can then use your pre-computed databases to check that files are
+intact (rfigc.py) and if they aren't, you can recover them (using
+header\_ecc.py and structural\_adaptive\_ecc.py). It can also help if
+you recovered your files via data scraping, because your files will be
+totally unorganized, but you can use a previously generated database
+file to recover the full names and directory tree structure using
+rfigc.py --filescraping\_recover.
+
+Also, you can try to fix some of your files using specialized repairing
+tools (but remember that such tool cannot guarantee you the same
+recovering capacity as an error correction code - and in addition, error
+correction code can tell you when it has recovered successfully). For
+example:
+
+-  for tar files, you can use `fixtar <https://github.com/BestSolution-at/fixtar>`_.
+   Similar tools (but older): `tarfix <http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/sw/unix/tarfix/>`_
+   and `tar-repair <https://www.datanumen.com/tar-repair/>`_.
+-  for RAID mounting and recovery, you can use "Raid faster - recover
+   better" (rfrb) tool by Sabine Seufert and Christian Zoubek:
+   https://github.com/lrq3000/rfrb
+-  if your unicode strings were mangled (ie, you see weird symbols),
+   try this script that will automatically demangle them:
+   https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy
+-  to repair tabular (2D) data such as .csv, try
+   `Carpenter <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Carpenter/>`_.
+-  tool to identify corrupted files in ddrescue images: 
+   `ddrescue-ffile <https://github.com/Salamek/ddrescue-ffile>`_
+
+Protecting directory tree meta-data
+-----------------------------------
+
+One main current limitation of pyFileFixity is that it cannot protect
+the directory tree meta-data. This means that in the worst case, if a
+silent error happens on the inode pointing to the root directory that
+you protected with an ecc, the whole directory will vanish, and all the
+files inside too. In less worst cases, sub-directories can vanish, but
+it's still pretty bad, and since the ecc file doesn't store any
+information about inodes, you can't recover the full path.
+
+The inability to store these meta-data is because of two choices in the
+design: 1- portability: we want the ecc file to work even if we move the
+root directory to another place or another storage medium (and of
+course, the inode would change), 2- cross-platform compatibility:
+there's no way to get and store directory meta-data for all platforms,
+but of course we could implement specific instructions for each main
+platform, so this point is not really a problem.
+
+To workaround this issue (directory meta-data are critical spots), other
+softwares use a one-time storage medium (ie, writing your data along
+with generating and writing the ecc). This way, they can access at
+the bit level the inode info, and they are guaranted that the inodes
+won't ever change. This is the approach taken by DVDisaster: by using
+optical mediums, it can compute inodes that will be permanent, and thus
+also encode that info in the ecc file. Another approach is to create a
+virtual filesystem specifically to store just your files, so that you
+manage the inode yourself, and you can then copy the whole filesystem
+around (which is really just a file, just like a zip file - which can
+also be considered as a mini virtual file system in fact) like
+`rsbep <http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/rsbep.html>`_.
+
+Here the portability principle of pyFileFixity prevents this approach.
+But you can mimic this workaround on your hard drive for pyFileFixity to
+work: you just need to package all your files into one file. This way,
+you sort of create a virtual file system: inside the archive, files and
+directories have meta-data just like in a filesystem, but from the
+outside it's just one file, composed of bytes that we can just encode to
+generate an ecc file - in other words, we removed the inodes portability
+problem, since this meta-data is stored relatively inside the archive,
+the archive manage it, and we can just encode this info like any other
+stream of data! The usual way to make an archive from several files is
+to use TAR, but this will generate a solid archive which will prevent
+partial recovery. An alternative is to use DAR, which is a non-solid
+archive version of TAR, with lots of other features too. If you also
+want to compress, you can just use ZIP (with DEFLATE algorithm) your
+files (this also generates a non-solid archive). You can then use
+pyFileFixity to generate an ecc file on your DAR or ZIP archive, which
+will then protect both your files just like before and the directories
+meta-data too now.
+
+Tools like pyFileFixity (or which can be used as complements)
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Here are some tools with a similar philosophy to pyFileFixity, which you
+can use if they better fit your needs, either as a replacement of
+pyFileFixity or as a complement (pyFileFixity can always be used to
+generate an ecc file):
+
+-  `DAR (Disk ARchive) <http://dar.linux.free.fr/>`__: similar to tar
+   but non-solid thus allows for partial recovery and per-file access,
+   plus it saves the directory tree meta-data -- see catalog isolation
+   -- plus it can handle error correction natively using PAR2 and
+   encryption. Also supports incremental backup, thus it's a very nice
+   versatile tool. Crossplatform and opensource.
+-  `DVDisaster <http://dvdisaster.net/>`__: error correction at the bit
+   level for optical mediums (CD, DVD and BD / BluRay Discs). Very good,
+   it also protects directory tree meta-data and is resilient to
+   corruption (v2 still has some critical spots but v3 won't have any).
+-  rsbep tool that is part of dvbackup package in Debian: allows to
+   generate an ecc of a stream of bytes. Great to pipe to dar and/or gz
+   for your backups, if you're on unix or using cygwin.
+-  `rsbep modification by Thanassis
+   Tsiodras <http://users.softlab.ntua.gr/~ttsiod/rsbep.html>`__:
+   enhanced rsbep to avoid critical spots and faster speed. Also
+   includes a "freeze" script to encode your files into a virtual
+   filesystem (using Python/FUSE) so that even meta-data such as
+   directory tree are fully protected by the ecc. Great script, but not
+   maintained, it needs some intensive testing by someone knowledgeable
+   to guarantee this script is reliable enough for production.
+-  Parchive (PAR1, PAR2, MultiPar): well known error correction file
+   generator. The big advantage of Parchives is that an ecc block
+   depends on multiple files: this allows to completely reconstruct a
+   missing file from scratch using files that are still available. Works
+   good for most people, but most available Parchive generators are not
+   satisfiable for me because 1- they do not allow to generate an ecc
+   for a directory tree recursively (except MultiPar, and even if it is
+   allowed in the PAR2 specs), 2- they can be very slow to generate
+   (even with multiprocessor extensions, because the galois field is
+   over 2^16 instead of 2^8, which is very costly), 3- the spec is not
+   very resilient to errors and tampering over the ecc file, as it
+   assumes the ecc file won't be corrupted (I also tested, it's still a
+   bit resilient, but it could be a lot more with some tweaking of the
+   spec), 4- it doesn't allow for partial recovery (recovering blocks
+   that we can and pass the others that are unrecoverable): with PAR2, a
+   file can be restored fully or it cannot be at all.
+-  Zip (with DEFLATE algorithm, using 7-Zip or other tools): allows to
+   create non-solid archives which are readable by most computers
+   (ubiquitous algorithm). Non-solid archive means that a zip file can
+   still unzip correct files even if it is corrupted, because files are
+   encoded in blocks, and thus even if some blocks are corrupted, the
+   decoding can happen. A `fast implementation with enhanced compression
+   is available in pure Go <https://github.com/klauspost/compress>`__
+   (good for long storage).
+-  TestDisk: for file scraping, when nothing else worked.
+-  dd\_rescue: for disk scraping (allows to forcefully read a whole disk
+   at the bit level and copy everything it can, passing bad sector with
+   options to retry them later on after a first full pass over the
+   correct sectors).
+-  ZFS: a file system which includes ecc correction directly. The whole
+   filesystem, including directory tree meta-data, are protected. If you
+   want ecc protection on your computer for all your files, this is the
+   way to go.
+-  Encryption: technically, you can encrypt your files without losing
+   too much redundancy, as long as you use an encryption scheme that is
+   block-based such as DES: if one block gets corrupted, it won't be
+   decryptable, but the rest of the files' encrypted blocks should be
+   decryptable without any problem. So encrypting with such algorithms
+   leads to similar files as non-solid archives such as deflate zip. Of
+   course, for very long term storage, it's better to avoid encryption
+   and compression (because you raise the information contained in a
+   single block of data, thus if you lose one block, you lose more
+   data), but if it's really necessary to you, you can still maintain
+   high chances of recovering your files by using block-based
+   encryption/compression (note: block-based encryption can
+   be seen as the equivalent of non-solid archives for compression,
+   because the data is compressed/encrypted in independent blocks,
+   thus allowing partial uncompression/decryption).

+   `here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bagit/>`__: this is a file
+   packaging format for sharing and storing archives for long term
+   preservation, it just formalizes a few common procedures and meta
+   data that are usually added to files for long term archival (such as

+-  `RSArmor <https://github.com/jap/rsarm>`__ a tool based on

+   you can print the characters on paper. May be interesting for small
+   datasets (below 100 MB).
+-  `Ent <https://github.com/lsauer/entropy>`__ a tool to analyze the
+   entropy of your files. Can be very interesting to optimize the error
+   correction algorithm, or your compression tools.
+-  `HashFS <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hashfs/>`_ is a non-redundant,
+   duplication free filesystem, in Python. **Data deduplication** is very
+   important for large scale long term storage: since you want your data
+   to be redundant, this means you will use an additional storage space
+   for your redundant copies that will be proportional to your original data.
+   Having duplicated data will consume more storage and more processing
+   time, for no benefit. That's why it's a good idea to deduplicate your data
+   prior to create redundant copies: this will be faster and save you money.
+   Deduplication can either be done manually (by using duplicates removers)
+   or systematically and automatically using specific filesystems such as
+   zfs (with deduplication enabled) or hashfs.
+-  Paper as a storage medium: paper is not a great storage medium,
+   because it has low storage density (ie, you can only store at most 
+   about 100 KB) and it can also degrade just like other storage mediums,
+   but you cannot check that automatically since it's not digital. However,
+   if you are interested, here are a few softwares that do that:
+   `Paper key <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_key>`_,
+   `Paperbak <http://www.ollydbg.de/Paperbak/index.html>`_,

+-  AVPreserve tools, most notably `fixity <https://github.com/avpreserve/fixity>`_ 
+   to monitor for file changes (similarly to rfigc, but actively as a daemon)
+   and `interstitial <https://github.com/avpreserve/interstitial>`_ to detect
+   interstitial errors in audio digitization workflows (great to ensure you
+   correctly digitized a whole audio file into WAV without any error).
+
+FAQ
+---
+
+-  Can I compress my data files and my ecc file?
+
+As a rule of thumb, you should ALWAYS keep your ecc file in clear
+text, so under no compression nor encryption. This is because in case
+the ecc file gets corrupted, if compressed/encrypted, the
+decompression/decrypting of the corrupted parts may completely flaw
+the whole structure of the ecc file.
+
+Your data files, that you want to protect, *should* remain in clear
+text, but you may choose to compress them if it drastically reduces
+the size of your files, and if you raise the resilience rate of your
+ecc file (so compression may be a good option if you have an
+opportunity to trade the file size reduction for more ecc file
+resilience). Also, make sure to choose a non-solid compression
+algorithm like DEFLATE (zip) so that you can still decode correct
+parts even if some are corrupted (else with a solid archive, if one
+byte is corrupted, the whole archive may become unreadable).
+
+However, in the case that you compress your files, you should generate
+the ecc file only *after* compression, so that the ecc file applies to
+the compressed archive instead of the uncompressed files, else you
+risk being unable to correct your files because the uncompression of
+corrupted parts may output gibberish, and length extended corrupted
+parts (and if the size is different, Reed-Solomon will just freak
+out).
+
+-  Can I encrypt my data files and my ecc file ?
+
+NEVER encrypt your ecc file, this is totally useless and
+counterproductive.
+
+You can encrypt your data files, but choose a non-solid algorithm
+(like AES if I'm not mistaken) so that corrupted parts do not prevent
+the decoding of subsequent correct parts. Of course, you're lowering a
+bit your chances of recovering your data files by encrypting them (the
+best chance to keep data for the long term is to keep them in clear
+text), but if it's really necessary, using a non-solid encrypting
+scheme is a good compromise.
+
+You can generate an ecc file on your encrypted data files, thus
+*after* encryption, and keep the ecc file in clear text (never encrypt
+nor compress it). This is not a security risk at all since the ecc
+file does not give any information on the content inside your
+encrypted files, but rather just redundant info to correct corrupted
+bytes (however if you generate the ecc file on the data files before
+encryption, then it's clearly a security risk, and someone could
+recover your data without your permission).
+
+- What medium should I use to store my data?
+
+The details are long and a bit complicated (I may write a complete article
+about it in the future), but the tl;dr answer is that you should use *optical disks*,
+because it decouples the storage medium and the reading hardware
+(eg, at the opposite we have hard drives, which contains both the reading
+hardware and the storage medium, so if one fails, you lose both)
+and because it's most likely future-proof (you only need a laser, which
+is universal, the laser's parameters can always be tweaked).
+
+From scientific studies, it seems that, at the time of writing this (2015),
+BluRay HTL disks are the most resilient against environmental degradation.
+To raise the duration, you can also put optical disks in completely opaque boxes
+(to avoid light degradation) and in addition you can put any storage medium
+(not only optical disks, but also hard drives and anything really) in
+*completely* air-tight and water-tight bags or box and put in a fridge or a freezer.
+This is a law of nature: lower the temperature, lower will be the entropy, in other
+words lower will be the degradation over time. It works the same with digital data.
+
+- What file formats are the most recoverable?
+
+It's difficult to advise a specific format. What we can do is advise the characteristics
+of a good file format:
+
+  * future-proof (should be readable in the future).
+  * non-solid (ie, divised into indepedent blocks, so that a corruption to one block doesn't cause a problem to the decoding of other blocks).
+  * open source implementation available.
+  * minimize corruption impact (ie, how much of the file becomes unreadable with a partial corruption? Only the partially corrupted area, or other valid parts too?).
+  * No magic bytes or header importance (ie, corrupting the header won't prevent opening the file).
+
+There are a few studies about the most resilient file formats, such as:
+
+  * `"Just one bit in a million: On the effects of data corruption in files" by Volker Heydegger <http://lekythos.library.ucy.ac.cy/bitstream/handle/10797/13919/ECDL038.pdf?sequence=1>`_.
+  * `"Analysing the impact of file formats on data integrity" by Volker Heydegger <http://old.hki.uni-koeln.de/people/herrmann/forschung/heydegger_archiving2008_40.pdf>`_.
+  * `"A guide to formats", by The UK national archives <http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/guide-to-formats.pdf>`_ (you want to look at the Recoverability entry in each table).
+
+- What is Reed-Solomon?
+
+If you have any question about Reed-Solomon codes, the best place to ask is probably here (with the incredible Dilip Sarwate): http://www.dsprelated.com/groups/comp.dsp/1.php?searchfor=reed%20solomon
+
+Also, you may want to read the following resources:
+
+  * "`Reed-Solomon codes for coders <https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_codes_for_coders>`_", free practical beginner's tutorial with Python code examples on WikiVersity. Partially written by one of the authors of the present software.
+  * "Algebraic codes for data transmission", Blahut, Richard E., 2003, Cambridge university press. `Readable online on Google Books <https://books.google.fr/books?id=eQs2i-R9-oYC&lpg=PR11&ots=atCPQJm3OJ&dq=%22Algebraic%20codes%20for%20data%20transmission%22%2C%20Blahut%2C%20Richard%20E.%2C%202003%2C%20Cambridge%20university%20press.&lr&hl=fr&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q=%22Algebraic%20codes%20for%20data%20transmission%22,%20Blahut,%20Richard%20E.,%202003,%20Cambridge%20university%20press.&f=false>`_.

-#=================================
-#
-# From : http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed-Solomon_error_correction
-# The key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a polynomial. The code relies on a theorem from algebra that states that any k distinct points uniquely determine a polynomial of degree at most k-1.
-# The sender determines a degree k-1 polynomial, over a finite field, that represents the k data points. The polynomial is then "encoded" by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than k points are actually sent. As long as sufficient values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.
-# In the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.
-# This is done automatically using a simple trick: the matrix inversion. For more infos, see this well-explained blog post by Richard Kiss: How to be Minimally Redundant (or "A Splitting Headache") http://blog.richardkiss.com/?p=264
-#
-# codeword_rate: rs = @(n,k) k / n
-# @(n,k) (n - k) / k
-#
-# To get higher resilience against corruption: make the codeword bigger (decrease k and increase n = higher resilience ratio), and use smaller packets (n should be smaller). Source: Kumar, Sanjeev, and Ragini Gupta. "Bit error rate analysis of Reed-Solomon code for efficient communication system." International Journal of Computer Applications 30.12 (2011): 11-15.
-# Note: in the paper, they told that their results indicate to use bigger blocks, but if you look at the Figure 4, this shows the opposite: the best performing parameters is: RS(246, 164) with code rate 0.66667 = resilience ratio 0.25
-# Note2: however, logically, it's more sensible to use bigger blocks to be more resilient. Indeed, since data stream is hashed and ecc'ed per block, this means that if an error burst corrupt a block twice the size of max_block_size (or just the size of max_block_size but exactly overlapping on one block, no shift), then the block will be unrecoverable. In other words, if we have bigger blocks, we raise the required size for an error burst to permanently corrupt our data (thus we diminish the risk). Thus, it would make sense to use error correcting codes with very big blocks. However, this would probably incur a huge performance drop, at least for Reed-Solomon which is basically grounded on matrix operations (thus the complexity would be about O(max_block_size^2), a quadratic complexity).
-#
-#  If 2s + r < 2t (s errors, r erasures) t
-#
-# TODO:
-# - Performance boost in Reed-Solomon libraries. A big work was done, and it's quite fast when using PyPy 2.5.0, but 10x more speedup (to attain 10MB/s encoding rate) would just be perfect! Decoding rate is sufficiently speedy as it is, no need to optimize that part.
-# Use Cauchy Reed-Solomon, which significantly outperforms simple Reed-Solomon?

-Description: Given a directory, generate or check/correct the headers (defined by a constant number of bits in arguments) for every files recursively. Using Reed-Solomon for the ECC management.
-Headers are the most sensible part of any file: this is where the format definition and parameters are specified, and in addition for compression formats, the beginning of the file (just after the header) is usually where the most important strings of data are stored and compressed. Thus, having a high redundancy specifically for the headers means that you ensure that you will be able to at least open the file (file format will be recognized), and for compressed files that the most important symbols will be restituted.
-The concept is to use this script in addition to more common parity files like PAR2 so that you get an additional protection at low cost (because headers are just in the first KB of the file, thus it won't cost much in storage and processing time to add more redundancy to such a small stream of data).
-Note: Folders meta-data is NOT accounted, only the files! Use DVDisaster or a similar tool to also cover folders meta-data.
-    '''
-    ep = '''Use --gui as the first argument to use with a GUI (via Gooey).
-
-Note1: this is a pure-python implementation (except for MD5 hash but a pure-python alternative is provided in lib/md5py.py), thus it may be VERY slow to generate an ecc file. To speed-up things considerably, you can use PyPy v2.5.0 or above, there will be a speed-up of at least 100x from our experiments (you can expect an encoding rate of more than 1MB/s). Feel free to profile using easy_profiler.py and try to optimize the encoding parts of the reed-solomon libraries.
-
-Note2: that Reed-Solomon can correct up to 2*resilience_rate erasures (eg, null bytes, you know where they are) or resilience_rate errors (an error is a corrupted character but you don't know its position) and amount to an additional storage of 2*resilience_rate storage compared to the original total files size.

+#=================================
+#
+# From : http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed-Solomon_error_correction
+# The key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a polynomial. The code relies on a theorem from algebra that states that any k distinct points uniquely determine a polynomial of degree at most k-1.
+# The sender determines a degree k-1 polynomial, over a finite field, that represents the k data points. The polynomial is then "encoded" by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than k points are actually sent. As long as sufficient values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.
+# In the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.
+# This is done automatically using a simple trick: the matrix inversion. For more infos, see this well-explained blog post by Richard Kiss: How to be Minimally Redundant (or "A Splitting Headache") http://blog.richardkiss.com/?p=264
+#
+# codeword_rate: rs = @(n,k) k / n
+# @(n,k) (n - k) / k
+#
+# To get higher resilience against corruption: make the codeword bigger (decrease k and increase n = higher resilience ratio), and use smaller packets (n should be smaller). Source: Kumar, Sanjeev, and Ragini Gupta. "Bit error rate analysis of Reed-Solomon code for efficient communication system." International Journal of Computer Applications 30.12 (2011): 11-15.
+# Note: in the paper, they told that their results indicate to use bigger blocks, but if you look at the Figure 4, this shows the opposite: the best performing parameters is: RS(246, 164) with code rate 0.66667 = resilience ratio 0.25
+# Note2: however, logically, it's more sensible to use bigger blocks to be more resilient. Indeed, since data stream is hashed and ecc'ed per block, this means that if an error burst corrupt a block twice the size of max_block_size (or just the size of max_block_size but exactly overlapping on one block, no shift), then the block will be unrecoverable. In other words, if we have bigger blocks, we raise the required size for an error burst to permanently corrupt our data (thus we diminish the risk). Thus, it would make sense to use error correcting codes with very big blocks. However, this would probably incur a huge performance drop, at least for Reed-Solomon which is basically grounded on matrix operations (thus the complexity would be about O(max_block_size^2), a quadratic complexity).
+#
+#  If 2s + r < 2t (s errors, r erasures) t
+#
+# TODO:
+# - Performance boost in Reed-Solomon libraries. A big work was done, and it's quite fast when using PyPy 2.5.0, but 10x more speedup (to attain 10MB/s encoding rate) would just be perfect! Decoding rate is sufficiently speedy as it is, no need to optimize that part.

+Description: Given a directory, generate or check/correct the headers (defined by a constant number of bits in arguments) for every files recursively. Using Reed-Solomon for the ECC management.
+Headers are the most sensible part of any file: this is where the format definition and parameters are specified, and in addition for compression formats, the beginning of the file (just after the header) is usually where the most important strings of data are stored and compressed. Thus, having a high redundancy specifically for the headers means that you ensure that you will be able to at least open the file (file format will be recognized), and for compressed files that the most important symbols will be restituted.
+The concept is to use this script in addition to more common parity files like PAR2 so that you get an additional protection at low cost (because headers are just in the first KB of the file, thus it won't cost much in storage and processing time to add more redundancy to such a small stream of data).
+Note: Folders meta-data is NOT accounted, only the files! Use DVDisaster or a similar tool to also cover folders meta-data.
+    '''
+    ep = '''Use --gui as the first argument to use with a GUI (via Gooey).
+
+Note1: this is a pure-python implementation (except for MD5 hash but a pure-python alternative is provided in lib/md5py.py), thus it may be VERY slow to generate an ecc file. To speed-up things considerably, you can use PyPy v2.5.0 or above, there will be a speed-up of at least 100x from our experiments (you can expect an encoding rate of more than 1MB/s). Feel free to profile using easy_profiler.py and try to optimize the encoding parts of the reed-solomon libraries.
+
+Note2: that Reed-Solomon can correct up to 2*resilience_rate erasures (eg, null bytes, you know where they are) or resilience_rate errors (an error is a corrupted character but you don't know its position) and amount to an additional storage of 2*resilience_rate storage compared to the original total files size.

-#### MULTIFILES AUX FUNCTIONS ####
-# Here are the aux functions to cluster files of similar sizes in order to generate multifiles ecc tracks in header_ecc.py and structural_variable_ecc.py
-# TODO in hecc and saecc:
-#  * make intra-fields filepath with multiple files paths, separated by "|" (eg: "filepath1|filepath2|filepath3"
-#  * make intra-fields multiple file sizes, just like filepaths: "filesize1|filesize2|filesize3"
-#  * intra-ecc should work just the same
-#  * adapt stream encoding and decoding to dispatch the bytes to the corresponding files.
-#  * stream encoding/decoding should be robust: when a file ecc track is either ended (file was smaller than the others) or corrupted, then fill with null bytes, the rest should work the same (at decoding, maybe can use erasures decoding to double the recovery rate, at encoding maybe try to not store the null bytes? But how? Normally, the files in a group should be in descending size order, so the first file will always have a track, but if the other files are smaller then nvm their ecc just won't be appended, thus we end up with a shorter ecc track, but we know that and we can just computationally append the missing null bytes, no harm and no risk of corruption since these bytes aren't stored! So at encoding this doubles the recovery rate towards the end of the file for the bigger file)..

+#### MULTIFILES AUX FUNCTIONS ####
+# Here are the aux functions to cluster files of similar sizes in order to generate multifiles ecc tracks in header_ecc.py and structural_variable_ecc.py
+# TODO in hecc and saecc:
+#  * make intra-fields filepath with multiple files paths, separated by "|" (eg: "filepath1|filepath2|filepath3"
+#  * make intra-fields multiple file sizes, just like filepaths: "filesize1|filesize2|filesize3"
+#  * intra-ecc should work just the same
+#  * adapt stream encoding and decoding to dispatch the bytes to the corresponding files.
+#  * stream encoding/decoding should be robust: when a file ecc track is either ended (file was smaller than the others) or corrupted, then fill with null bytes, the rest should work the same (at decoding, maybe can use erasures decoding to double the recovery rate, at encoding maybe try to not store the null bytes? But how? Normally, the files in a group should be in descending size order, so the first file will always have a track, but if the other files are smaller then nvm their ecc just won't be appended, thus we end up with a shorter ecc track, but we know that and we can just computationally append the missing null bytes, no harm and no risk of corruption since these bytes aren't stored! So at encoding this doubles the recovery rate towards the end of the file for the bigger file)..

-        # The first pass is obviously the most interesting, here's a description: we use a kind of greedy algorithm but with backtracking, meaning that we simply read through all the strings sequentially and just compare with the markers and compute the Hamming distance: if the Hamming distance gets below the threshold, we trigger the found marker flag. Then if the Hamming distance decreases, we save this marker position and disable the found marker flag. However, there can be false positives like this (eg, the marker is corrupted in the middle), so we have a backtracking mechanism: if a later string is found to have a Hamming distance that is below the threshold, then we check if the just previously found marker is in the range (ie, the new marker's position is smaller than the previous marker's length) and if the Hamming distance is smaller, then we replace the previous marker with the new marker's position, because the previous one was most likely a false positive.
-        # This method doesn't require any other file than the ecc file, but it may not work on ecc markers that are too much tampered, and if the detection threshold is too low or the markers are too small, there may be lots of false positives.

+        # The first pass is obviously the most interesting, here's a description: we use a kind of greedy algorithm but with backtracking, meaning that we simply read through all the strings sequentially and just compare with the markers and compute the Hamming distance: if the Hamming distance gets below the threshold, we trigger the found marker flag. Then if the Hamming distance decreases, we save this marker position and disable the found marker flag. However, there can be false positives like this (eg, the marker is corrupted in the middle), so we have a backtracking mechanism: if a later string is found to have a Hamming distance that is below the threshold, then we check if the just previously found marker is in the range (ie, the new marker's position is smaller than the previous marker's length) and if the Hamming distance is smaller, then we replace the previous marker with the new marker's position, because the previous one was most likely a false positive.

-    The main job of this function is to walk through the input folders and align the files, so that we can compare every files across every folders, one by one.
-    The whole trick here is to align files, so that we don't need to memorize all the files in memory and we compare all equivalent files together: to do that, we ensure that we walk through the input directories in alphabetical order, and we pick the relative filepath at the top of the alphabetical order, this ensures the alignment of files between different folders, without memorizing  the whole trees structures.
-    '''
-    # (Generator) Files Synchronization Algorithm:
-    # Needs a function stable_dir_walking, which will walk through directories recursively but in always the same order on all platforms (same order for files but also for folders), whatever order it is, as long as it is stable.
-    # Until there's no file in any of the input folders to be processed:
-    # - curfiles <- load first file for each folder by using stable_dir_walking on each input folder.
-    # - curfiles_grouped <- group curfiles_ordered:
-    #    * curfiles_ordered <- order curfiles alphabetically (need to separate the relative parent directory and the filename, to account for both without ambiguity)

-    #        . if nextelt == curfiles_grouped[last_group][0]: add nextelt into curfiles_grouped[last_group] (the latest group in curfiles_grouped)
-    #        . else: create a new group in curfiles_grouped (last_group += 1) and add nextelt into curfiles_grouped[last_group]
-    # At this stage, curfiles_grouped[0] should contain a group of files with the same relative filepath from different input folders, and since we used stable_dir_walking, we are guaranteed that this file is the next to be processed in alphabetical order.

-    desc = '''Replication Repair
-Description: Given a set of directories (or files), try to repair your files by scanning each byte, cast a majority vote among all copies, and then output the winning byte. This process is usually called triple-modular redundancy (but here it should be called n-modular redundancy since you can use as many copies as you have).
-It is recommended for long term storage to store several copies of your files on different storage mediums. Everything's fine until all your copies are partially corrupted. In this case, this script can help you, by taking advantage of your multiple copies, without requiring a pregenerated ecc file. Just specify the path to every copies, and the script will try to recover them.
-Replication can repair exactly r-2 errors using majority vote (you need at least 2 blocks for majority vote to work), where r is the number of replications: if r=3, you get a redundancy rate of 1/3, if r=4, rate is 2/4, etc.
-This script can also take advantage of a database generated by rfigc.py to make sure that the recovered files are correct, or to select files that are already correct.
-
-Note: in case the end result is not what you expected, you can try a different order of input directories: in case of ambiguity, the first input folder has precedence over subsequent folders.
-Note2: in case some files with the same names are of different length, the merging will continue until the longest file is exhausted.
-Note3: last modification date is not (yet) accounted for.

+    # Until there's no file in any of the input folders to be processed:
+    # - curfiles <- load first file for each folder by using stable_dir_walking on each input folder.
+    # - curfiles_grouped <- group curfiles_ordered:

+Description: Given a set of directories (or files), try to repair your files by scanning each byte, cast a majority vote among all copies, and then output the winning byte. This process is usually called triple-modular redundancy (but here it should be called n-modular redundancy since you can use as many copies as you have).
+It is recommended for long term storage to store several copies of your files on different storage mediums. Everything's fine until all your copies are partially corrupted. In this case, this script can help you, by taking advantage of your multiple copies, without requiring a pregenerated ecc file. Just specify the path to every copies, and the script will try to recover them.
+Replication can repair exactly r-2 errors using majority vote (you need at least 2 blocks for majority vote to work), where r is the number of replications: if r=3, you get a redundancy rate of 1/3, if r=4, rate is 2/4, etc.
+This script can also take advantage of a database generated by rfigc.py to make sure that the recovered files are correct, or to select files that are already correct.
+
+Note: in case the end result is not what you expected, you can try a different order of input directories: in case of ambiguity, the first input folder has precedence over subsequent folders.
+Note2: in case some files with the same names are of different length, the merging will continue until the longest file is exhausted.
+Note3: last modification date is not (yet) accounted for.

-Description: Given a directory and a configuration file (containing the commands to execute before and after file tampering), this script will generate a testing tree, where the files will be corrupted randomly and then the supplied repair commands will be executed, and repair stats will be computed at each step (for each stage and repair commands).
-
-The testing process works in stages:
-1- Before_tamper stage: Run preparatory commands before tampering (useful to generate ecc/database files).
-2- Tamper stage: Tamper the files and/or databases.
-3- After_tamper stage: Run after tampering commands, aka preparatory commands before repair stage.
-4- Repair stage: Run repair commands, each repair command reusing the files generated (partially repaired) by the previous stage. This is indeed your repair workchain that you define here.
-5- Statistics are generated for each stage.
-
-Note that the original files are never tampered, we tamper only the copy we did inside the test folder.
-Also note that the test folder will not be removed at the end, so that you can see for yourself the files resulting of each stage, and eventually use other tools to compute additional stats.

+Description: Given a directory and a configuration file (containing the commands to execute before and after file tampering), this script will generate a testing tree, where the files will be corrupted randomly and then the supplied repair commands will be executed, and repair stats will be computed at each step (for each stage and repair commands).
+
+The testing process works in stages:
+1- Before_tamper stage: Run preparatory commands before tampering (useful to generate ecc/database files).
+2- Tamper stage: Tamper the files and/or databases.
+3- After_tamper stage: Run after tampering commands, aka preparatory commands before repair stage.
+4- Repair stage: Run repair commands, each repair command reusing the files generated (partially repaired) by the previous stage. This is indeed your repair workchain that you define here.
+5- Statistics are generated for each stage.
+
+Note that the original files are never tampered, we tamper only the copy we did inside the test folder.
+Also note that the test folder will not be removed at the end, so that you can see for yourself the files resulting of each stage, and eventually use other tools to compute additional stats.

-# TODO:
-# - Copy corrupted/error files to another location (while preserving folders tree) so that user can try to repair them.
-# - Add interface to a repair software/library? (at least for images and maybe videos and archives zip/tar.gz)
-# - Check similar files: make list of hashes and compare each new file to the hashes database to see if a file that is not in our db ressembles a file in our db, maybe indicating that the file was moved (problem: the check currently is based on database: we walk through database entries, so we cannot detect new files. We would need to do another branch for this special check, or at least do it after the normal check.)
-# - multidisks option: allow to continue checking files on removable drives so that you can spread your archives on several disks and check them all with only one database file.
-# - moviepy try to open video file that is tampered?
-# - add replace md5 and sha1 by farmhash and murmurhash? (non-cryptographic hashes, but it would require importing third-party libraries! no pure python anymore!)
-#
-# NOTE: this software is similar in purpose to the (more advanced) MD5deep / HashDeep for hash set auditing: http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/

-Description: Recursively generate or check the integrity of files by MD5 and SHA1 hashes, size, modification date or by data structure integrity (only for images).
-
-This script is originally meant to be used for data archival, by allowing an easy way to check for silent file corruption. Thus, this script uses relative paths so that you can easily compute and check the same redundant data copied on different mediums (hard drives, optical discs, etc.). This script is not meant for system files corruption notification, but is more meant to be used from times-to-times to check up on your data archives integrity.
-    '''
-    ep = '''Example usage:
-- To generate the database (only needed once):
-python rfigc.py -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -g
-- To check:
-python rfigc.py -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -l log.txt -s
-- To update your database by appending new files:
-python rfigc.py -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a 
-- To update your database by appending new files AND removing inexistent files:
-python rfigc.py -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a -r
-- To use with a gui:
-python rfigc.py --gui
-
-Note that by default, the script is by default in check mode, to avoid wrong manipulations. It will also alert you if you generate over an already existing database file.
-Note2: you can use PyPy to speed the generation, but you should avoid using PyPy when in checking mode (from our tests, it will slow things down a lot).

+# TODO:
+# - Copy corrupted/error files to another location (while preserving folders tree) so that user can try to repair them.
+# - Add interface to a repair software/library? (at least for images and maybe videos and archives zip/tar.gz)
+# - Check similar files: make list of hashes and compare each new file to the hashes database to see if a file that is not in our db ressembles a file in our db, maybe indicating that the file was moved (problem: the check currently is based on database: we walk through database entries, so we cannot detect new files. We would need to do another branch for this special check, or at least do it after the normal check.)
+# - multidisks option: allow to continue checking files on removable drives so that you can spread your archives on several disks and check them all with only one database file.
+# - moviepy try to open video file that is tampered?
+# - add replace md5 and sha1 by farmhash and murmurhash? (non-cryptographic hashes, but it would require importing third-party libraries! no pure python anymore!)
+#
+# NOTE: this software is similar in purpose to the (more advanced) MD5deep / HashDeep for hash set auditing: http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/

+Description: Recursively generate or check the integrity of files by MD5 and SHA1 hashes, size, modification date (any file) or by data structure integrity (only for images).
+
+This script is originally meant to be used for data archival, by allowing an easy way to check for silent file corruption. Thus, this script uses relative paths so that you can easily compute and check the same redundant data copied on different mediums (hard drives, optical discs, etc.). This script is not meant for system files corruption notification, but is more meant to be used from times-to-times to check up on your data archives integrity.
+    '''
+    ep = '''Example usage:
+- To generate the database (only needed once):
+pff hash -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -g
+- To check:
+pff hash -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -l log.txt -s
+- To update your database by appending new files:
+pff hash -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a 
+- To update your database by appending new files AND removing inexistent files:
+pff hash -i "folderimages" -d "dbhash.csv" -u -a -r
+- (Deprecated) To use with a Gooey gui:
+pff hash --gui
+
+Note that by default, the script is by default in check mode, to avoid wrong manipulations. It will also alert you if you generate over an already existing database file.
+Note2: you can use PyPy to speed the generation, but you should avoid using PyPy when in checking mode (from our tests, it will slow things down a lot).

-#=================================
-#
-# From : http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed-Solomon_error_correction
-# The key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a polynomial. The code relies on a theorem from algebra that states that any k distinct points uniquely determine a polynomial of degree at most k-1.
-# The sender determines a degree k-1 polynomial, over a finite field, that represents the k data points. The polynomial is then "encoded" by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than k points are actually sent. As long as sufficient values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.
-# In the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.
-# This is done automatically using a simple trick: the matrix inversion. For more infos, see this well-explained blog post by Richard Kiss: How to be Minimally Redundant (or "A Splitting Headache") http://blog.richardkiss.com/?p=264
-#
-# codeword_rate: rs = @(n,k) k / n
-# @(n,k) (n - k) / k
-#
-# To get higher resilience against corruption: make the codeword bigger (decrease k and increase n = higher resilience ratio), and use smaller packets (n should be smaller). Source: Kumar, Sanjeev, and Ragini Gupta. "Bit error rate analysis of Reed-Solomon code for efficient communication system." International Journal of Computer Applications 30.12 (2011): 11-15.
-# Note: in the paper, they told that their results indicate to use bigger blocks, but if you look at the Figure 4, this shows the opposite: the best performing parameters is: RS(246, 164) with code rate 0.66667 = resilience ratio 0.25
-# Note2: however, logically, it's more sensible to use bigger blocks to be more resilient. Indeed, since data stream is hashed and ecc'ed per block, this means that if an error burst corrupt a block twice the size of max_block_size (or just the size of max_block_size but exactly overlapping on one block, no shift), then the block will be unrecoverable. In other words, if we have bigger blocks, we raise the required size for an error burst to permanently corrupt our data (thus we diminish the risk). Thus, it would make sense to use error correcting codes with very big blocks. However, this would probably incur a huge performance drop, at least for Reed-Solomon which is basically grounded on matrix operations (thus the complexity would be about O(max_block_size^2), a quadratic complexity).
-#
-#  If 2s + r < 2t (s errors, r erasures) t

-# TODO:
-# - Performance boost in Reed-Solomon libraries. A big work was done, and it's quite fast when using PyPy 2.5.0, but 10x more speedup (to attain 10MB/s encoding rate) would just be perfect! Decoding rate is sufficiently speedy as it is, no need to optimize that part.

+#=================================
+#
+# From : http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed-Solomon_error_correction
+# The key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a polynomial. The code relies on a theorem from algebra that states that any k distinct points uniquely determine a polynomial of degree at most k-1.
+# The sender determines a degree k-1 polynomial, over a finite field, that represents the k data points. The polynomial is then "encoded" by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than k points are actually sent. As long as sufficient values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.
+# In the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.
+# This is done automatically using a simple trick: the matrix inversion. For more infos, see this well-explained blog post by Richard Kiss: How to be Minimally Redundant (or "A Splitting Headache") http://blog.richardkiss.com/?p=264
+#
+# codeword_rate: rs = @(n,k) k / n
+# @(n,k) (n - k) / k
+#
+# To get higher resilience against corruption: make the codeword bigger (decrease k and increase n = higher resilience ratio), and use smaller packets (n should be smaller). Source: Kumar, Sanjeev, and Ragini Gupta. "Bit error rate analysis of Reed-Solomon code for efficient communication system." International Journal of Computer Applications 30.12 (2011): 11-15.
+# Note: in the paper, they told that their results indicate to use bigger blocks, but if you look at the Figure 4, this shows the opposite: the best performing parameters is: RS(246, 164) with code rate 0.66667 = resilience ratio 0.25
+# Note2: however, logically, it's more sensible to use bigger blocks to be more resilient. Indeed, since data stream is hashed and ecc'ed per block, this means that if an error burst corrupt a block twice the size of max_block_size (or just the size of max_block_size but exactly overlapping on one block, no shift), then the block will be unrecoverable. In other words, if we have bigger blocks, we raise the required size for an error burst to permanently corrupt our data (thus we diminish the risk). Thus, it would make sense to use error correcting codes with very big blocks. However, this would probably incur a huge performance drop, at least for Reed-Solomon which is basically grounded on matrix operations (thus the complexity would be about O(max_block_size^2), a quadratic complexity).
+#
+#  If 2s + r < 2t (s errors, r erasures) t
+#
+# TODO:
+# - Performance boost in Reed-Solomon libraries. A big work was done, and it's quite fast when using PyPy 2.5.0, but 10x more speedup (to attain 10MB/s encoding rate) would just be perfect! Decoding rate is sufficiently speedy as it is, no need to optimize that part.

+Description: Given a directory, this application will generate error correcting codes or correct corrupt files, using a structural adaptive approach (the headers will be protected by more ecc bits than subsequent parts, progressively decreasing in the resilience).
+Note: Folders meta-data is NOT accounted, only the files! Use DVDisaster or a similar tool to also cover folders meta-data.
+    '''
+    ep = '''
+Note1: this is a pure-python implementation (except for MD5 hash but a pure-python alternative is provided in lib/md5py.py), thus it may be VERY slow to generate an ecc file. To speed-up things considerably, you can use PyPy v2.5.0 or above, there will be a speed-up of at least 100x from our experiments (you can expect an encoding rate of more than 1MB/s). Feel free to profile using easy_profiler.py and try to optimize the encoding parts of the reed-solomon libraries.
+
+Note2: that Reed-Solomon can correct up to 2*resilience_rate erasures (eg, null bytes, you know where they are) or resilience_rate errors (an error is a corrupted character but you don't know its position) and amount to an additional storage of 2*resilience_rate storage compared to the original total files size.

 The problem of long term storage

 Long term storage is thus a very difficult topic: it's like fighting with
 death (in this case, the death of data). Indeed, because of entropy,
 data will eventually fade away because of various silent errors such as
 bit rot or cosmic rays. pyFileFixity aims to provide tools to detect any data
 corruption, but also fight data corruption by providing repairing tools.
